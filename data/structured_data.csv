At the last inspection on 1 April 2015, no  regulations had been breached and the service was rated good overall but there was some improvement  required in certain aspects of the service.  At this inspection we found that improvements had been made.   Victoria Lodge Care Home is a residential care home which provides accommodation with personal care for  up to 24 older people.  At the time of our inspection 22 people were living at the home.   A registered manager was in place.   A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  and associated Regulations about how the service is run.    People living in Victoria Lodge were very happy with the service they received because they felt safe,  comfortable and valued by the staff that supported them. The registered manager and provider provided  very strong leadership that ensured that people were at the centre of everything that was done. The  registered manager and provider led by example and ensured the development of an ethos and culture  where people were valued as individuals and where they were supported to feel at home. This helped  people to feel a sense of belonging and being valued.    The registered manager carried out audits and checks to ensure the home was running properly to meet  people's needs and to monitor the quality of the care people received. The provider was involved in the  home on a daily basis and knew people and their relatives personally and showed a keen interest in their  well being. There were close links with the local community shops and services so that people were able to  do everyday things such as shopping. The registered manager was involved in supporting local schools to  develop their students' interests in the needs of people that received care in an effort to encourage them to  consider a career in health and social care. Improvements were identified through consultation with people, relatives and professionals involved in the home. For example, the provider had planned to provide  accommodation for relatives to use so that they could be close to their loved ones when they were unwell.   This showed that the provider placed a high value on meeting the needs of people and their relatives.  People received care that was kind and compassionate, tailored to the individual and provided by staff that  were respectful, trained, well supported and managed to ensure that people received an excellent caring  service. Relationships with families and friends were cherished and developed so that people were able to  maintain and develop their ties with people important to them. Friends and families built relationships with  other people living in the home and often continued to visit them after their own family members had  passed away. This provided people living in the home with a continuation of friendships and interactions  with a wide group of people that were interested in them as individuals and that enhanced their quality of  life. Staff had been commended by relatives about the support they and their loved ones had received  during the difficult times at the end of their loved one's lives.  2 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  People were supported to eat in a calm and supportive environment that provided opportunity to socialise  as well as eat. People received food and drinks that they liked and that met their dietary needs. A freshly  prepared meal was available to people in the home on a daily basis and some people were able to be  involved in the mealtime experience through baking, setting the tables and clearing up after meals. People  were enabled to eat at times that suited their needs and a freshly prepared meal available at most times  during the day.  Staff told us they liked working in the home because they had time to spend with people supporting them in the way they [people] wanted. Staff treated people professionally but also that showed that people were  valued and important to them through the way they were spoken with, offering reassurance through hugs  and holding people's hand if appropriate. Staff felt supported by the registered manager and provider and  were supported through training and meetings where their views were listened to. Staff were encouraged to  develop their skills so that they could develop their professionalism and take additional responsibilities in  the home. Many of the staff had worked there for several years providing people with a continuity of care.   Staff were responsive to changes in people's needs ensuring that their physical, social and emotional needs  were met.  People's ability to make decisions was assessed and where people lacked the mental capacity to  consent to their care and welfare actions were taken in their best interests. There were excellent  communications with other professionals involved in people's care and people's friends and relatives  ensuring that all the relevant individuals were involved in meeting people's needs.  The provider had taken  suitable action when they had identified people who did not have capacity to consent to their care or  treatment and applications had been made to authorise restrictions on people's liberty in their best  interests.  People were supported to be involved in activities that met their individual needs and skills. These activities  were available in group settings and on a one to one basis both in the home or out in the community.   People told us they had no complaints about the service they received but were confident if they did, that  the provider would deal with it effectively.   No complaints had been raised but we saw there was a  complaints process in place.  People and relatives told us they felt the Victoria Lodge was a safe and homely environment for people to  live in.  People were protected from abuse because staff could identify the different types of abuse and knew what actions to take to report abuse.  Risks to people were being monitored and staff were supported to  minimise the risk of injury whilst enabling people to maintain a safe level of independence. People and  relatives were encouraged to be involved in the home and voice their opinions about proposed  developments.  We saw staff were busy but there were sufficient staff available to provide support to people when needed.  This included support for people to eat, drink and move around the home safely and to be involved in  activities that they wanted to be involved in. The provider's recruitment processes ensured suitable staff  were recruited.    At the last inspection although no regulations had been breached, some improvement was required in  respect of some aspects of the management of medicines. At this inspection we found all the required  improvements had been made and people received their medicines as prescribed.    3 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was safe  People told us they felt safe.  People were safeguarded from the  risk of harm because staff were able to recognise abuse and  knew the appropriate action to take.    Risks to people's health and safety had been identified and were  known to the staff.  This ensured people received safe care and  support.  People were supported by suitably recruited staff.  People were supported by staff to take their medicines as  prescribed.  	  The service was effective.   There were arrangements in place to ensure that decisions were  made in people's best interest.  Staff sought ppeople's consent  before they provided care and support.  People were supported by suitably trained staff.  People enjoyed the meals provided and were given drinks at  regular intervals, or when requested.  People's nutritional needs  were assessed and monitored to identify any risks associated  with nutrition and hydration.  People received support from healthcare professionals to  maintain their health and wellbeing when it was required.  	  The service was very caring.  People received an outstanding service from staff that were  extremely kind and compassionate. People were respected  as  individuals ensuring they were supported to make choices in all  aspects of their lives.  4 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  Good    Good    Outstanding    People's independence was promoted and where needed  support was provided so that people's privacy and dignity was  maintained.  People's relationships with their friends and relatives were  valued and the importance of these relationships was  understood by staff. The care and compassion received by  people was extended to families who also felt supported by the  staff and registered manager. Families were supported to learn  about their family member's health conditions so that they could better understand the impact on people.  	  The service was extremely responsive.    People and their families were supported in a very responsive  way that ensured that needs were kept under constant review.  Staff knew people really well and delivered care in a way which  met individual needs and preferences.  Activities were stimulating and catered to meet people's  individual needs and could be met in group setting or on a one  to one basis. Developing friendships and preventing isolation  was a very strong theme in the home.   People were provided with plenty of information and  opportunities to raise concerns but said they had no complaints.  They were confident the provider would address any concerns in  a timely way. The views of people, relatives and other  professionals involved in people's care were asked for their views so that areas for improvement could be identified and actioned.  	  The service was very well led.  People lived in a home where the ethos was about people  believing it was their home and where they were sure their views  were valued. Staff were supported and developed to be the best  they could.   People and their representatives were integral to the running of  the home and links were made with the local community to  ensure people continued to feel a part of that community.   Audits were carried to ensure that an outstanding quality service  was provided. The registered manager and provider looked at   5 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  Good    Outstanding    ways in which the service could be continually improved for the  betterment of people living and working there.  6 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017     Victoria Lodge Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This unannounced inspection took place on 26 January 2017. The inspection team consisted of one  inspector and an expert by experience.  An expert by experience is a person who has personal experience of  using or caring for someone who uses this type of service.  We asked the provider to complete a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks the provider  to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to  make. The PIR was returned within the required timescale.  As part of the inspection process we also looked  at information we already had about the provider. Providers are required to notify the Care Quality  Commission about specific events and incidents that occur including serious injuries to people receiving  care and any incidences which put people at risk of harm. We refer to these as notifications. We reviewed the notifications that the provider had sent us, to plan the areas we wanted to focus on during our inspection.   We reviewed regular quality reports sent to us by the local authority to see what information they held about the service. These are reports that tell us if the local authority has concerns about the service they purchase  on behalf of people.      We spoke with nine people, four relatives, the registered manager, the provider, three health care  professionals and three care staff.    We looked at records in relation to three people's care and six medicine records to see how their care and  treatment was planned and delivered.  Other records we looked at included three staff recruitment and  training files.  This was to check that suitable staff were recruited, trained and supported to deliver care to  meet people's individual needs.  We also looked at records relating to the management of the service,  complaints and surveys to ensure people received a quality service.  7 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   	  Good  	"   People and relatives all gave us very positive feedback about their experiences of the service and how staff  made them feel safe. One person told us, ""I feel safe with the staff.""  A relative told us, ""Definitely safe. They  [staff] constantly reassure [person], especially at night. They [staff] sit with her, spend time with her. We're so lucky we chose the right place."" People told us and we saw that the emergency call was always placed so  that they [people] could access it from wherever they were in their bedroom. One person told us, ""The girls  are lovely, always come quickly if buzzer is used [to get assistance]."" Staff spoken with were clear about the  actions they would take if they had any concerns that someone was at risk of abuse or their [person  receiving a service] behaviour showed a change suggesting something had happened to them. Staff told us  they would report any concerns to the registered manager or provider and were sure that the appropriate  actions would be taken. Staff were also aware of external agencies they could contact to raise any concerns  such as social services and the Care Quality Commission (CQC).   People's care plans included risk assessments and management plans. We saw that risk assessments in  place covered areas such as falls, poor nutrition and skin damage. People we spoke with told us that they  were aware of their risks and the actions that had been put in place to minimise them. For example, one  person told us they had to use the walking frame to minimise their risk of falling. People had equipment to  meet their physical and health care needs such as pressure relieving mattresses and cushions. One person  told us about the air flow mattress on their bed and the reason why they had it in place. This showed that  staff discussed risks to people's health with them. We saw staff put into practice what was written in  people's risk assessments and care records.  Staff spoken with knew about people's risk. These included  safety measures in place if people were prone to falls or at risk of choking and staff were able to explain the  action they would take. We saw that people had individual evacuation plans in place detailing the support  they would need in the event of a fire and staff were able to explain this information to us. The Provider  Information Return (PIR) told us that regular safety tests were carried out to ensure that equipment was safe. We saw that mobility aids had been tested to ensure they were safe for use.  During our inspection we saw staff were not rushed and responded promptly and compassionately to  people's request for support. People and relatives told us that there were sufficient staff to support people.  One person told us, ""The girls are busy but there are enough of them. I think they are getting a couple more  staff to start this week."" During our inspection the registered manager and staff confirmed that some staff  had been employed recently.  Another person told us, ""You have to wait a bit sometimes. Not too long  though."" A relative told us, ""There always seems to be loads of staff."" A lovely lady does the entertainment  and she takes [person] to a little coffee shop and if she [person] is a bit distressed they come down to my  house."" Staff felt there were sufficient numbers of staff to meet people's needs. We saw that there was a  stable staff team at the home which meant that people were supported by staff that knew them well.   We looked at the staff rota which showed that the same numbers of staff were available to meet people's  needs during weekdays and weekends showing there was a consistent service. In addition to care staff there  were volunteers and relatives that were involved in the home on a regular basis which meant that people  had a variety of people to interact with. There were also additional catering, activities and cleaning staff   8 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  which meant that care staff were able to concentrate on meeting people's needs. The registered manager  and provider told us they monitored people's needs and staffing levels were adjusted if people's  dependency levels increased. Staff spoken with told us that additional staff were brought on duty if  someone was unwell or if someone was going out for an appointment. The PIR told us and staff confirmed  that the appropriate recruitment checks were undertaken before they started their employment. These  included a check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and references from previous employers. The DBS checks helped employers ensure that only staff suitable to work with people that needed support were  employed.  Medicines were managed safely and ensured people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us  that they always received their medicines on time. One person said, ""I get my medicines, they [staff] bring  them four times a day.""  People spoken with knew what medicines they were taken and what they were for.  The medicines storage room and trolley were kept locked when not in use ensuring that only the authorised  staff were able to access the medicines. Stock was managed well so that people were not left without  medicines they needed. Medicine administration records had been completed as required and protocols  were in place where medicines had to be given on as and when required basis. Protocols were also in place  for when medicines were given disguised in food and drink. An assessment had been carried out by the  person's GP to ensure the medicines were required to be given in this way because it was in the person's  best interests so they remained healthy.  Medicines were given consistently by staff that had been trained in  safe medicines management and that had access to the appropriate guidance.   9 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives we spoke with told us that the service was very effective at meeting their needs. One  person said, ""It's nice here, staff help me when needed."" Before our inspection we had received some  positive comments from relatives telling us about the excellent care people received. One relative told us  that the person receiving the service and the family had been very happy with the care given by staff during  the time the person was in the home.  Another relative commented, ""From our experience, we have found  that the facilities and care are excellent."" One professional involved in the home told us that they found the  home to be ""hassle free"" and had knew that advice given would be followed by the care staff.  Staff were supported to provide good, effective care to people through training, advice and guidance. Staff  development was encouraged and supported so they took responsibility and ownership to deliver good  care that met people's individual needs. . One person receiving a service told us, ""Staff know what they are  doing. The girls [staff] are great."" Staff told us that they received induction training based on the care  certificate when they started work. The care certificate is a framework for good practice for the induction of  staff and sets out what they should know to provide good, effective care. Staff spoken with and training  records looked at showed that staff received ongoing training. Staff spoken with confirmed training enabled  them to have up to date knowledge and skills to ensure people were cared for safely and effectively. One  member of staff told us, ""[name of registered manager] and [provider] encourage us to do further training  and take on roles that we are responsible for."" Staff spoken with and records showed that staff received  regular one to one discussion with a senior member of staff to discuss their development.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People told us that staff always asked what help they wanted and that they were able to do as  much for themselves as possible. For example, one person told us they were able to get up when they  wanted and was quite independent in getting themselves washed and dressed. Another person told us,  ""They [staff] do ask. For example, do I want to get up?"" We saw that mental capacity assessments were in place for the people that had limited capacity to make  major decisions about their care. Staff spoken with and records confirmed that relatives and relevant  professionals were involved in making decisions in their [person's] best interests. Staff spoken with had a  good understanding of the need to act in some people's best interests to keep them safe.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are  called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the  principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. We saw that the registered manager had made the necessary applications for people that were  considered to be deprived of their liberty. The registered manager said she had received verbal  authorisation for two people and written authorisation had been received for one person. The registered   10 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  manager was aware of the need to inform us when authorisations had been granted to deprive a person of  their liberty.   People were complimentary about the food available. One person told us, ""We have three hot meals a day.  We have drinks in-between and we can have snack for supper."" The person went onto say that they could  ask for drinks at any time they wanted and they would be given one. People told us that the main meal was put on the menu board outside the kitchen and although there was  one meal prepared they were able to have an alternative if they did not like what had been cooked.   People told us that generally they liked the meals on offer and there was flexibility about when they ate their meals. One person told us, ""You will get something different if you don't like the meal but I like the food.""  Another person said, ""The food is good."" A third person told us, ""I sometimes don't feel like eating. Staff  bring me small meals regularly – five times in the day. The doctor has said to eat small meals several times a  day. I also have two additional drinks [food supplement] through the day."" Another person told us,  ""Sometimes I'm still in bed at half past nine in the morning. I can still have my breakfast if I get up late."" A  relative told us, ""The food's really good, it's all homemade.""  The registered manager and provider told us that there were some meals that were ready prepared and  could be cooked at short notice. This meant people could still have a freshly cooked meal, if they had a  missed a meal for any reason.   We saw that people received assistance and encouragement to eat their meal when needed. Staff told us  that they monitored people to ensure that they were eating sufficient amounts to remain healthy.  This  included observing what people were eating on a day to day basis and raising concerns if they noted that  people were not eating well. Meals could be fortified to increase people's calorie intake. People's weights  were monitored for possible signs of underlining medical problems.  Records showed that there was input  from healthcare professionals if there were concerns about people not eating well or having swallowing  difficulties.  People health was monitored routinely to help their well-being. People told us about on going monitoring  for conditions they had and told us that they were able to see the doctor if they felt unwell. A relative told us  about an occasion when their family member was unwell and a blood test was arranged which showed  raised blood sugar levels. The relative told us staff were, ""On the ball"".   A number of health professionals visited the service to assess people and support them to remain as  healthy as possible. These included doctors, nurses, opticians and chiropodists. We spoke with two  professionals that visited the home. Both told us that they felt people were supported to maintain their  health and any advice they gave to staff was followed and advice sought when needed. During our  inspection we saw a nurse visiting the home to assess people and support the staff to minimise the risk of  skin damage to people who were at risk. There was no one in the home at the time of our inspection that  had developed any skin damage whilst living there. People told us that they could see the doctor when they  needed to see one and they were supported to attend hospital appointments. One person told us, ""I get to  see GP and attend hospital reviews.""  11 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People living in Victoria Lodge were happy because they felt valued as individuals by the people that lived  there, the staff that worked there, the registered manager and provider. We observed  a very homely  atmosphere in the home and relatives told us that this is what they liked about Victoria Lodge. Our  observations of this were reinforced to us by an individual that lived at Victoria Lodge who encouraged us to  come back and visit them and told us, ""The door is always open. You know you're always welcome. There'll  be tea and cake for you."" This showed the person was acting as a host, confident in the belief that this was  their home. A comment we had received from a relative about the service said, ""During her stay she was  treated with extreme care and respect whilst ensuring her wellbeing and dignity were paramount at all  times. In fact she felt so comfortable from the first day she said she did not want to return to her own  bungalow and referred to Victoria Lodge as 'The Hotel'. Even when she had a fall and was hospitalised for  two weeks she was desperate to return to 'The Hotel'. Which she achieved. The love and care which she was  given by all of the staff was magnificent. Equally the friendliness and support given to family not only at the  end of mum's life but during the whole of her stay to the extent, as a family, we very quickly came to look on  all of the staff as friends .""   A relative told us that one person had liked the home so much they did not want to leave after they came to  the home for a short stay. The relative said, ""She came for three weeks respite and when we came to collect  her she said ""Do I have to go home?"" The person had been there ever since. The relative went on to say, ""To  this day she [person] loves it. We can see her deteriorate, but she says, ""This is my home."" A healthcare  professional involved in the home told us, ""The home has a friendly feel to it and staff are very attentive,  respectful and professional with myself and service users."" We saw people were spoken with by staff in a  caring, respectful and dignified way because staff used people's preferred names to address them, or using  words of endearment to which people responded with smiles and we saw staff hug people providing  contact and affection. There was a real affection in the way staff spoke with people and gave them  reassurances.   The ethos and culture developed by the registered manager and staff was one of valuing people and  treating people as individuals. Care people received was very kind, caring and compassionate. Staff took  time to listen to people, respond to their questions and interacted with people as they went about their  tasks. Staff spent time chatting, laughing, joking and dancing with people. We saw that touch, such as  holding people's hands and  giving them a hug,  was used by staff to reassure people and  to make them feel valued,. We saw that people enjoyed this interaction through the smiles and banter they shared with staff.   We saw that support was offered to people discreetly. We saw that support provided at lunchtime was  correctly paced to meet the needs of the individuals and ensured that people were supported to eat as  independently as possible. Everyone we spoke with was very complimentary about the staff that supported  them.   Comments and compliments that had been received by the registered manager from families of people that  had passed away showed that the care provided had been extremely caring and compassionate for both the individual and the family members. We saw that relatives were encouraged to visit the home for tea and a   12 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  chat even after their family member was no longer resident at the home so that they could  maintain  relationships with people they had come to consider as friends and were able to share memories of their  loved ones. One person's relatives had been supported to continue to visit the home, with their dog, who  had become a welcomed visitor to the home for a number of people that lived there. This meant that people could continue to see the dog they had got to know.   The caring attitude of the whole staff team extended to the friends and relatives of the people that lived in  the home. Relatives told us that they not only visited their family members but also spent time chatting with  other people in the home because it was like a 'big, happy family'. This meant that people met and had  conversations with a variety of people helping them to have a greater level of interaction with different  people. This helped to make life more interesting and created a sense of community between the people  using the service and their relatives.   The provider understood the importance of family relationships and friendships for people and worked hard to help ensure these were maintained. One relative told us, ""This is now our second home."" We saw relatives were involved in special celebrations such as Christmas, birthdays and running a small shopping trolley so  people could purchase small items of their choice so that they could retain some independence. Relatives  were sent a copy of a newsletter that showed what was happening in the home and at the end of this was  the activities planner for the month. This enabled relatives to plan their visits so that they could be involved  in activities such as quizzes if they wished.   The provider was very closely involved in the running of Victoria Lodge. We saw that the provider knew  everyone  living in the home and their family members personally and took an interest in how everyone felt.  The staff, registered manager and provider received a high level of praise for the way in which people were  cared for at the end of their life. Community health professionals were involved to make this passage as easy as possible for people. The provider always visited and supported people, and their families, when they  [person living at the home] was nearing the end of their life. People's passing was shared with the other  people living in the home in a sensitive manner. The provider ensured that people who wanted to attend the funeral of someone they had lived with were supported to do so and that flowers were sent from people that lived in the home if that was what they wanted. Thank you cards and letters from relatives whose loved ones had passed away showed their appreciation for the caring, compassionate service their relative had  received. A relative had commented, ""Her [person receiving a service] dignity, comfort and well-being was  unquestionable, also the support provided to our family helped us accept what was happening.""   People lived in a comfortable, homely environment that met their needs. One person told us that they had  been supported to bring their furniture from home so that they felt like it was the bedroom in their own  house.  One relative commented, ""Victoria Lodge does not feel like a care home. The staff and environment  make it feel like it is the home of the people that live here.""  We saw that the home was personalised with  pictures and belongings belonging to the people living there. During our inspection we saw that the music  that was being played was a CD that belonged to an individual living there. This reinforced to the individual  that their choice of music was valued and that the choices of people was paramount.  We saw that the culture of compassion and respect extended to friends and relatives who felt the staff,  registered manager and provider treated them as though they were part of an extended family. Meetings  had been arranged with guest speakers, such as from the Alzheimer's Society, to speak with relatives and  people living in the home. This helped people to develop an understanding of how dementia can affect  people and their families so that people could make sense of their experiences. The registered manager and  provider had also facilitated the development of a social group for relatives so that they could meet  independently of the home to share their experiences.   13 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  The registered manager and provider had an excellent understanding of how the 'atmosphere' in Victoria  Lodge was important to the people living there and the negative emotional states that people could be  experiencing. For example, people living with dementia may be experiencing fear, anger, depression and  anxiety. We saw that the atmosphere in Victoria Lodge was one that was calm, relaxing, welcoming and  homely which helped people to feel comfortable and well cared for. One comment made by a relative in a  survey said, ""A touch, a few words, time spent reassuring a resident whose visitors hadn't arrived, a game of  dominos - just some of the kindnesses we saw  that make Victoria Lodge a loving and caring environment for its residents.""   We saw that staff spoke gently with people and supported them at a pace and manner that was appropriate  to the individual. We saw that one person who believed that they were at the home until they got better was  not told otherwise. The registered manager, staff and provider told us that after speaking with the persons  relative's that it would be very upsetting for the individual to hear that they were not going home so staff  spoke with her about her[person's] 'convalescence'. The provider told us, ""[Person] probably does know  deep down inside that she is here to stay but does not want to say so."" This showed that people's emotional  needs were recognised and dealing in this way with the issue showed dignity and respect for the person's  feelings and a compassionate response to her beliefs and wishes.   People's life histories were recorded and staff spoken with were aware of what people liked to do. For  example we heard how one person was regularly involved in assisting the cook in the kitchen and another  person had been involved in planting bulbs in the garden because they had previously enjoyed gardening.  People and their relatives told us that they were involved in making decisions about care and that  communications between them and the staff were good. It was evident from conversations we overheard  that people living in the home were encouraged to share details about their lives and skills with others. We  heard one person say to a member of staff that she [person] was ready to carry on teaching the staff  member to knit. We saw that the provider also shared details of her life with people which helped people to  feel valued and important enough to have this information shared with them.  For example, we heard  people ask about the health of a family member of the provider and make arrangements to go and visit  them.   People told us that their privacy and dignity was maintained. We saw that there were en-suite facilities  attached to bedrooms so that people could be supported with dignity and privacy. We saw staff ensured  doors were closed when personal care was taking place. People told us staff always knocked on their  bedroom doors before entering. Some people had keys to be able to lock their bedroom doors when they  left them. Some people told us that they did not want to lock their doors. During meal times we saw that  people were offered clothes protectors if they wanted. Staff sat at the tables so that they were sitting at the  same level as people enabling them [staff] to support people to eat at an appropriate pace without standing over people and chatted to people about the things that interested them to make the mealtime a sociable  and enjoyable occasion.   We saw that where possible people were supported to maintain their independence. We saw that one  person was encouraged to eat independently but received guidance and support when they struggled.  Another person told us that the staff supported them to do as much for themselves as possible but were  available to provide assistance when needed. We saw that walking aids such as walking frames and sticks  were left in reach of people so that they could move about independently.   14 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Good  	"   Relatives told us that the supportive and responsive ethos of the registered manager began from the point  when people first visited the home. The registered manager supported people and their relatives in helping  them to choose the right place for the person to live in. One relative commented that when they visited the  home the registered manager had given them details of other services in the area. They had also been  advised about the type of things to look at when visiting other service in order to decide which care home  was most suitable for their loved one. They told us, ""[Registered manager] didn't just tell us about Victoria  Lodge."" This showed that the registered manager considered the suitability of the home for the individual  more important than ensuring full capacity in the home.  We saw that the personalised approach to care ensured that people's social, emotion and spiritual needs  were met. For example, one person told us that they were no longer able to get out to the church but there  were regular visits from the priest so that their religious and spiritual needs were met.  A relative told us that  their family member was anxious and unsettled at night and rather than the person be given medication to  reduce their anxieties the provider suggested they moved into a double room so that they felt there was  always someone nearby. We were told by the relative that this had 'worked a treat' and their family member  was much more settled.  We saw that a male volunteer came into the home to sit, chat, watch football and  have a game of dominoes with another person so that their social needs were met appropriately with  contact with people of their own gender. The activities co-ordinator told us that during the build up to  Christmas people had been supported to go to the shops to buy presents and cards. It soon became evident that there were some people that were unable to go to the shops due to health or mobility issues. In  response a local chemist, sweetshop, shoe shop and card shop were contacted who were happy to set up  an indoor Christmas market in the home. This meant that everyone living in the home was able to attend the market with support and assistance because the appropriate actions were taken.  People enjoyed a wide range of activities that were tailored to meet individual needs. For example, the staff  recognised that one person living with dementia was spending a lot of time looking at their hands and  pulling at their fingers. The person was known to have enjoyed knitting previously.  A specific activity was  organised where the person could sit and untangle some wool which kept their hands busy and they were  involved in doing something that they may have done in the past. The activities coordinator told us that they knew it was a good activity for the person when the person turned to the person sitting next to her to help  her rewind it. The provider had also purchased items such as sensory lamps, an IPad and communication  aids to help meet people's individual needs and make leisure opportunities accessible to them.  We saw that there were everyday activities that people could be involved in which supported their feelings of having their skills valued. For example, one person told us that they were regularly involved in cooking things such as  cakes and biscuits and we saw that pictures of these activities were included in the monthly newsletter. We  saw another person help the cook tidy the tables and sweep the floor after lunch.  We were told by the  provider that at the end of the activity the cook and person would sit and have a cup of tea together before  the person told the cook she was going home but would return tomorrow. The cook had become a 'special  friend' to this person helping the person to feel important and have a sense of purpose to her day. Other  activities in the home included exercises, quizzes, baking sessions and ballroom dancing.  One person living   15 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  in the home was interested in the how Victoria Lodge was run as the person had run their own business. A  member of staff told us that they had taken time to explain staff rotas, routines and the responsibilities of  different staff. The staff told us, ""She [person] feels very much part of what is going on now.""  Regular visits were made by outside entertainers and the ongoing involvement of relatives of people that no  longer lived in the home. During our inspection some entertainers came into the home to share their skills in ballroom dancing. People watched the entertainers dance before some people got up to dance with them.  We saw that people who were not able to move around were involved in some armchair dance moves.  Everyone who wanted to be involved in the activity thoroughly enjoyed themselves but other people who  did not like the noise were guided to another quieter area in the home so that they were not disturbed.  During this activity we saw that staff confidently were able to de-escalate a situation where one person felt  that another person had sat in their seat. The person was sensitively guided to another area and distracted  until they had calmed down and then brought back to enjoy the entertainment.  In a recent survey response, one person commented 'I'm encouraged to join in activities by caring and  supportive staff. There's a happy, caring atmosphere and we're not just sat round in front of a TV'. There was an activities coordinator who produced a detailed calendar of activities which offered different things for  people to do, at least twice each day. The activities programme was shared with relatives so that they could  be involved if they wanted.  The activities coordinator knew people well and told us that they prompted  people they knew might be interested in particular sessions. They continuously asked people for feedback  about activities and what they might like to do. For example, involving friends and relatives in 'the big family  quiz' and involving people in suggesting images to be placed on the home's website so that relatives could  see what activities were happening on a monthly basis.   We saw that people's well-being was being maintained and promoted because all the staff engaged with  people in ways that prevented them becoming isolated whilst also being respectful of people's choice not to always partake in activities. For example, we saw that where people did not want to be involved in activities  they were supported to return to their bedroom or to another sitting area in the home. The activities  coordinator visited people in their rooms for one-to-one conversation and individual activities if they chose  not to be involved in group activities.   We looked to see how complaints were managed. There had not been any complaints over the past couple  of years but we were told that the day before our visit a comment had been made to a member of staff  about feeling rushed during the support they received. This had been passed onto the registered manager  promptly who was looking into the issue. The individual had told the registered manager that they did not  want it to be a complaint however, we saw that the registered manager was responsive to even the most  minor concerns. The registered manager told us, ""Even if it is not a complaint it is a learning process and we  will use it as an example of how the little things can make people feel.""  We saw that a large number of compliments about the service had been received. One comment on the  home's website stated, ""Just a little message to say a big thank you for all your help and support over the  last few months. It is truly, thoroughly appreciated. Your help and support has been a god send. All the staff  are amazing and you deserve a special recognition for the outstanding work that you do."" People and  relatives told us that they would speak with the staff or registered manager if they had any concerns but we  heard again and again from people that there was nothing to complain about.   People were well-informed about the process for making complaints. The provider had produced a  comprehensive information pack for people, which included information about how to make a complaint if   16 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  needed.   Other systems in place to gather the views of people included regular surveys based on topics such as care,  safety and security, food and drink, communication and support. Comment from one of the surveys carried  out by the provider included, ""Always feel well supported and any issues raised are taken seriously and  responded to."" There were also regular meetings for people to attend. A suggestion was made by people  that protective aprons at mealtimes should be available in different colours to co-ordinate with the clothing  worn by people, aprons were bought in different colours to respond to this suggestion.  17 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   The registered manager and provider promoted a culture and ethos that was based on supporting people in a person centred way and to help staff to be the best they could, so that people received an excellent,   personalised, quality service. We heard people saying they felt this was their home and there was not a 'one  fits all approach' in respect to people, particularly people living with dementia.  People that lived in Victoria Lodge, their relatives, staff and visiting professionals were consistently positive  and complimentary about the service provided and the management of the home. The provider and  registered manager had developed and maintained a quality of service that met people's needs and  regulations associated with the carrying on of a care home. This was possible because the registered  manager and provider had a robust oversight of the quality of care provided resulting in them being the eyes and ears for the people that lived there. People told us the provider and registered manager were always  accessible. One relative told us, ""It's not just her [provider's] business and it's not just a place of work [for the registered manager].  There was an open and honest culture and people told us they would have no hesitation in approaching the registered manager or provider. People were supported and encouraged to be involved in the day to day  running of the home along with their relatives. Regular contact with people and their families meant the  registered manager and provider were able to pick up on and address any minor issues quickly ensuring  that people felt listened to and valued.  The provider and registered manager explained to people what they  were going to do to prevent reoccurrences of issues and apologised to people when things had gone wrong.  There were meetings for people, relatives and staff to raise issues and suggest improvements. We saw that  some of these had been acted on and where they could not, the reasons were discussed. The provider told  us, ""We listen, feel the emotions of our service users and become actively involved to ensure we are  delivering the high quality of care they deserve.""  Everything we heard and saw during our inspection  reflected that this was happening.  Staff told us that they loved their jobs because they were supported to provide compassionate care and had the opportunity to spend time with people.  One relative told us, ""There's no large turnover of staff here and  they're all interested in the people and the families."" Staff gave a resounding vote of confidence in the home  when they told us that they would be more than happy for their relatives to live at Victoria Lodge. Staff  morale was high because of the support they received from the registered manager and provider. One  member of staff told us, ""[Registered manager] has an open door policy, talks a lot [with us] so nothing is a  surprise.""  Another staff member told us, ""The manager will get stuck in if we need support.""  Another said,  ""The manager is approachable, experienced, knowledgeable and families feel comfortable in approaching  her.""   The provider told us that staff were rewarded through empowerment and a financial bonus scheme, social  events, but also by highlighting their achievements in the home's newsletter and by internal promotion. The  provider told us that they felt confident that they would be successful in the process of applying for the  Investors in People Award which was helping them to improve the service people received through the   18 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  development of staff that cared for them. A visiting professional told us, ""The standard of care is very good  from what I see. The registered manager and owner take great pride in making the residents feel they are at  home. There is a good mix of youth and experienced staff and the team work well together from the  domestics to the management.""  The registered manager and provider were constantly looking for new experiences for people so that they  benefitted from lives that were more fulfilled. They had built links with the community through the  introduction of talks on caring for people living with dementia by the Alzheimer's Society. They were also   part of 'Dementia Friends' and by working closely with this agency they had been able to put  advice,   information and training they had received into practice to ensure a more person centred approach to the  way care was delivered to people living with dementia.  Following discussions at a meeting with people and  their relatives the registered manager was actively working with local care homes to have mutual visits to  the homes to enable people to build new friendships and have new experiences. During the run up to  Christmas local businesses were encouraged to set up stalls in the home for people unable to go out to the  shops  There was on open and inclusive atmosphere where people were valued and supported to use their skills  and experiences.  Relatives were encouraged to be involved in activities, preparing the newsletter and  carrying out surveys and taking people to the local shops and facilities such as the doctors. People were  enabled to undertake daily activities which were important to them such as laying tables and clearing up  after meals and baking biscuits and cakes to be eaten in the home by people and their relatives. The  provider told us that they had bought an electronic device so that people could look at photographs on a  larger screen. Some people were involved in developing the website for the provider and some people had  been filmed with their comments about what it was like living at Victoria Lodge. Other people had been  involved in choosing images to go on the website.       There were good relationships with local healthcare teams who went into the home to advise on how to  prevent deteriorations in people's health. A visiting healthcare professional told us, ""The home has a friendly feel to it and staff are very attentive, respectful and professional towards myself and service users.""  We saw that the management structure in the home had been developed to encourage staff already  working in the home to develop their skills and roles and take responsibilities for specific areas such as  management of medicines.  Staff confirmed that they were supported to develop their skills and knowledge  to take up these responsibilities and felt a sense of achievement and personal development. Discussions  with the registered manager showed that she felt a sense of personal achievement seeing staff develop with  her assistance and achieve qualifications to improve their career aspirations. We saw that the registered  manager encouraged the involvement of local schools by offering placements in the home for students. The  registered manager had been invited to speak with students about how people leaving their homes could  feel a lack of control over their lives. This helped to raise awareness and understanding about people's  needs and encourage young people to consider a career in care so that people would benefit from a caring  and understanding future staff pool being available.  The registered manager ensured that she also developed her skills and knowledge through ongoing training  and attending meetings with other care providers. The registered manager and provider provided strong  role models for staff and demonstrated through their commitment to the service concern for people's  welfare and the service's focus on providing, excellent care based on individual needs.  In addition staff told  us that they had lots of opportunity to talk about work and personal issues and felt supported by the  registered manager and provider. We learnt of an example of staff being supported by the registered  manager when people told us that the registered manager was a good cook. When we asked how they   19 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  [people] knew this one person said, ""She [registered manager] cooked our Christmas dinner."" The registered manager told us she had done this because she liked cooking and so that the cook could have the day off.  Staff were encouraged and supported to raise any issues regarding poor practice. For example, we heard  about a passing comment from one person living in the home to a staff member who brought it to the  attention of the registered manager. The registered manager told us that this incident would be used as a  topic of discussion with staff. They [staff] could then be reminded about how their actions could be  perceived by people and to ensure that practices were continually reviewed and improved. This strong  leadership meant that staff were confident in raising concerns and people and their relatives were reassured that any shortfalls in the service would be identified and addressed. The provision of a consistently  improving and good quality service had been evidenced through a waiting list of people wanting to live in  Victoria Lodge; local authority assessments that showed the service rated highly in their quality  assessments; regular inspection by the Care Quality Commission as well as through the provider's  monitoring of views of people and their representatives.   A variety of methods were used to gather people's views about how the service was performing and how it  might be improved. These included regular surveys of people and their families and visitors, such as  entertainers and healthcare professional. This helped the provider to get a complete picture of what people  thought about the service and assessing whether any changes were needed.  There were regular staff  meetings and supervision sessions for staff as well as meetings for people and their relatives. This provided  an opportunity for people to voice their concerns, wishes and hopes for the future and provide praise and  compliments. One person told us, ""We have meetings and they [staff] tell us all about what is planned. We  can ask questions and any our input is welcomed."" The records of these meetings confirmed that feedback  was provided to people about what was happening in the home and took comments and ideas from people  for future development of the service. For example, people were consulted about the style and colour of new furniture for communal areas of the home.   Thought was put into how the service could be developed to improve the overall care experience for people  and their relatives and to improve the facilities for staff. We saw that there were robust systems in place to  monitor the quality, improve and develop the service. The registered manager and provider maintained a  close oversight of the service so that issues were resolved quickly and without a negative impact on people.  We saw that since our last inspection there had been considerable input into improving the environment  through an ongoing refurbishment programme. The décor had been upgraded; new comfortable, stylish  furniture had been bought and people had been involved in choosing the colour scheme. A new passenger  lift had replaced the older model. The provider had completed the Provider Information Return and this told us about improvements that were being planned for the future. For example, an area of the home was to be  developed to provide accommodation where relatives could stay overnight when their loved ones were  unwell or coming towards their final days. An additional seating area for people was planned as well as  additional resources for staff to take their breaks in in response to suggestions from people using the service and staff.   The registered manager had been in post for several years and with the support of the provider had ensured  that the home was compliant with regulations and met their legal obligations in respect of keeping us  informed about incidents that occurred in the home.  We saw that the provider worked closely with  Birmingham and Solihull local authorities to ensure people were kept safe. We had received information  about incidents in the home so we could monitor the performance of the provider. This showed an open  and inclusive culture and an understanding of the Duty of Candour. The Duty of Candour is a requirement of  the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (regulated activities) Regulations 2014 that requires registered persons  to act in an open and transparent way with people in relation to the care and treatment they received.  20 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  21 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  "

Sandown Park Care Home is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or  personal care as a single package under one contractual agreement. We regulate both the premises and the  care provided, and both were looked at during this inspection.  Sandown Park Care Home can accommodate 95 people across three floors, each of which has separate  adapted facilities. The service cares for adults, including people living with dementia. The premises are  modern and purpose-built. People live in their own bedrooms and have access to communal facilities such  as a dining, lounge and activities areas. There is an expansive landscaped sensory garden surrounding the  building. At the time of our inspection, there were 84 people living at the service.  The provider is required to have a registered manager as part of their conditions of registration. A registered  manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like  registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting  the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service  is run. At the time of our inspection, there was a registered manager in post.  The risk of harm to people was significantly reduced by the systems and processes in place at the service.  This included prevention of harm by abuse, neglect, discrimination, injuries and accidents. People's care  documentation and the support they received ensured their maximum safety. When harm occurred, this was swiftly acted on and the service used any incident as a point for reflection and to put strategies in place to  prevent similar events in the future. There was a safe amount of staff deployed and robust recruitment  processes. People were protected from the risk of infections. The service was clean and well-maintained.  The management of people's medicines was robust.  The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) and associated  codes of practice. People were assisted to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff  supported them in the least restrictive way possible. The policies and systems in the service supported this  practise.   Staff induction, training, supervision and performance appraisals were extensive and ensured workers had  the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively support people. People's care preferences, likes and  dislikes were assessed, recorded and respected. We found there was appropriate access to other  community healthcare professionals. People were supported to maintain a very healthy lifestyle. People  complimented the food and drink and we found the risks of malnutrition and dehydration were  satisfactorily managed.  The service remained very caring. There was overwhelming complimentary feedback from people who used   2 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  the service, their family and community healthcare professionals. People told us they were able to  participate in care planning and reviews and we saw evidence of decision-making that promoted people's  independence. People's privacy and dignity was respected when care was provided to them. We observed  respectful care by staff.  The service continued to provide outstanding person-centred care. Care plans were thorough and  contained information of how to support people in the best possible way. We saw there was complaints  system in place which included the ability for people to contact any staff member or the management team. Questionnaires were used to determine people's satisfaction with the care. People and their families had a  say in the everyday decision-making and operation of the service.   The service was run by a committed management duo and care was provided by a passionate, effective  team of staff. There were numerous positive opinions about the management and leadership of the service.  There was an excellent workplace culture and we saw the staff worked cohesively to ensure good care for  people. The turnover rate of staff was low, which demonstrated staff liked to work at Sandown Park Care  Home. Audits and checks were used to gauge the safety and quality of care. The provider met the conditions of registration and complied with other relevant legislation related to the adult social care sector.   The service consistently strived to ensure that people had the best possible care, and that they were  supported in a compassionate, dignified and safe way. The service had forged successful partnerships with  an array of other stakeholders, was actively involved in research and innovation and aimed to provide an  excellent care experience for people. The service frequently referred to best practise guidelines to formulate  the type and style of care provided for people. Learning from projects and studies at the service were shared  with other care operators, both locally and nationally. The service's staff were often nominated for, and  commended in, national care sector awards. These factors demonstrated that Sandown Park Care Home  was a outstanding service for adult residential social care in England.  3 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  Good    Good    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was safe.  Effective systems were in place to protect people from the risks  of abuse or neglect.  Appropriate risk assessments about people's care were  completed and regularly reviewed.

Quality and safety were continuously at the forefront of the care  people received.  5 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018     Sandown Park Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  Our inspection took place on 9 January and 10 January 2018 and was unannounced.  Our inspection was completed by two adult social care inspectors and an expert-by- experience. An expert- by-experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of  care service. Our expert-by-experience had knowledge of people living with dementia.  We reviewed information we already held about the service. This included notifications we had received. A  notification is information about important events which the service is required to send us by law. We also  checked feedback we received from members of the public, local authorities and clinical commissioning  groups (CCGs). We checked records held by Companies House, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)  and the local fire inspectorate.  We spoke with eight people who used the service and seven relatives who visited during our inspection.   We spoke with the registered manager, the deputy manager, the administrator, the receptionist, three  activities coordinators and the maintenance person. We also spoke with five registered nurses and seven  care workers about people's support and treatment. We spoke with the GP, a visiting social worker, a vicar  and a representative from the CCG.   We looked at seven people's care records, two staff personnel files and other records about the  management of the service. After the inspection, we asked the registered manager to send us further  documents and we received and reviewed this information. This evidence was included as part of our  inspection.  6 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   	  Good  	"   People and relatives provided positive feedback about the safety of care. One person said, ""The location  layout; it works well for me."" The next person told us, ""It's got very high standards, clean with good staff.""  The next person said, ""It's comfortable and clean."" Other comments included, ""I get on well with all the  staff"", Very good and very caring. They have been extremely attentive to mum and me"", ""She (the person)  has improved very much since she came in"", ""It's a nice environment. (Care workers) have very good  personalities and are very caring"", ""(Staff) seem to care and understand her (the person's) dislikes. (There is  a nice environment )"" and ""Care from (the carer) is excellent with mum; understanding and patient and  always happy.""  The service had established safeguarding policies and procedures. Information on how to report  safeguarding concerns was displayed in the office on each floor, along with relevant contact numbers for the local safeguarding team. Staff we interviewed confirmed that they had training in safeguarding with regular  updates. They were able to provide definitions of different forms of abuse when asked. Staff said they would  report any concerns about abuse or neglect to the senior staff member on duty or the manager and most  said that it was also necessary to inform the local authority safeguarding team whenever a safeguarding  alert was reported.   There was good evidence that the service assessed and managed risks. Each person's care file contained a  pre-admission assessment of needs and risks and there were a range of dependency and risk scores for  different aspects of care such as the malnutrition universal screening tool, Waterlow scores to assess skin  integrity and falls risk scores. These were updated monthly, including weight records and were up-to-date.  Any risks associated with medical conditions, physical, environmental or psychological risks were addressed in the relevant care plans and in most cases there was direction on how to manage and mitigate any  identified risk. Any allergies were clearly noted at the front of each care file.   We made a recommendation at our last inspection about fire safety. The service had acted on our  recommendation. Each care file had a personal evacuation plan and a fire risk assessment which specified  levels of mobility and the equipment and staff support that would be required in the event of emergency.  This information was clear and well documented. We saw that the service had ensured safety from the  premises was properly managed. There was evidence of a Legionella risk assessment, gas safety certificate,  safety checks of the hoists, slings and passenger lifts. There was a health and safety checklist completed  weekly by the maintenance person and a periodic health and safety audit. The maintenance person was  very knowledgeable about how to ensure people's safety .  We asked the service at our last inspection to consider reviewing external access for visitors with mobility  impairments. We saw the service had dedicated a parking space at the front door for 'blue badge' holders  and had enforced parking measures to ensure visitors could easily enter the building. All other areas of the  service were reviewed to ensure wheelchair accessibility. Trips, slips and falls hazards were reviewed and  removed to prevent harm to people or visitors.  7 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  At our prior inspection, we made a recommendation about safe staffing deployment. We found the service  took action to ensure this was acted on. The registered manager explained the method of calculating  people's care hours needed. This was regularly reviewed and adjustments to staffing levels were made as  needed. During our inspection we found a strong visible presence of staff. People were not left alone or  neglected. Call bells were answered promptly. The registered manager explained that there were no staff  vacancies, and that the service had not used any agency workers. When we reviewed the rotas, we saw that  additional staff worked above the calculated deployment levels. Additional support to people was readily  accessible from the three activities coordinators.  Robust recruitment processes remained in place. This included thorough scrutiny and checks of applicants  for any role. We found the service ensured the correct information was available in personnel files. This  included proof of identity, criminal history checks, and references from prior employers, job histories and  health declarations. The service ensured only fit and proper persons were employed to care for people.  Systems were in place that showed people's medicines were managed consistently and safely by the  registered nurses. Medicines, including controlled drugs were being obtained, stored, administered and  discarded appropriately. We observed registered nurses during the administration of medicines to people,  and found their practice was methodical, patient and in line with local and national guidelines. The service  was subject to regular audits of the medicines management. We saw both the community pharmacist and  provider had checked medicines safety in 2017. Where areas for improvement were identified, these  formulated an action plan which was overseen by the deputy manager and registered manager.  All areas of the service were very clean, including communal areas, bathrooms and toilets. There were hand  sanitisers and hand gels available throughout the premises in communal areas and appropriate  handwashing signage was displayed in toilets and bathrooms. Staff wore personal protective equipment  (like gloves and disposable aprons) when they delivered personal care and at meal times. Staff said they  received training on infection control and the management team said they conducted regular spot checks  to ensure that infection control procedures were being followed correctly. We observed domestic staff using  colour-coded cleaning equipment and there were locked cupboards for storing chemicals.  We asked staff about the procedure for reporting accidents and incidents at the service and they were able  to explain this along with the forms that were completed in the event of an accident. Body maps in care  plans were completed and dated to record any bruises or wounds. Photographs were taken to document  any injuries to people. Staff said that there were daily handover meetings on each unit to discuss any  concerns or incidents. The management team were able to cascade any shared learning from incidents or  accidents. The service had a very low rate of serious injuries, like fractures or pressure ulcers with just four  occurrences in a one year period. The registered manager showed us how incidents and accidents were  analysed each month. Medical alerts and food safety warnings were obtained and shared with staff.  8 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives told us they felt staff were knowledgeable and skilled. One person stated , ""They are  quite knowledgeable, especially the nurses. All staff are very helpful."" Another person told us, ""Nurses are  (the best). (My) family rate them (staff) quite highly. One or two are exceptional..."" A relative told us, ""Yes. I  can't fault them."" Other comments included, ""Yes I do (think staff are experienced). They have got to know  her (the person) very well and are attentive"" and ""Yes, she (the person) is doing very well here (and is) very  happy.""  We reviewed a selection of care plans and found they were easy to navigate and well-ordered, with clear and consistent indexing so that information about people could be easily located by anyone. As this was a new  system of care planning, all information was recent with all care plans dated within the prior three months.  Assessments were carried out on admission and this information was used to develop comprehensive care  plans in consultation with the person and their family members. Care plans were evaluated on a monthly  basis with the person or their relatives, to ensure that they remained relevant and up-to-date. There were  separate care plans for each aspect of care. Each care plan outlined individual needs, the support required  and the desired outcomes or goals for care in each case.   Most care plans we saw were detailed, legible and tailored to each individual with identified risks, and needs clearly recorded. They were dated and signed by registered nurses and care staff. In some cases more  information was required by staff after ongoing consultations with people's families. There were clear  examples of people's and relatives' input into the care choices. This commenced from the pre-admission  phase and continued until the person's end of life. When a person was not capable of making care decisions  for themselves, independent advocates assisted them. We saw evidence that an advocate was involved in a  person's care choices. People were fully involved in their care planning which ensured effective care from  the staff at the service.  Nursing staff carried out assessments for people, developed and updated care plans. Care staff said that  they learnt about the needs and progress of people either by talking to nursing staff, to the person  themselves or by reading the individual care plans when they had time. Care staff we interviewed  demonstrated that they were familiar with the individual needs and characteristics of different people. They  were able to explain how to support specific people, along with any medical conditions or risks that they  needed to be aware of such as mobility needs, those at risk of choking and those who preferred to talk to  staff in their rooms rather than engage in activities.  Staff had access to very good support for their learning and professional development needs. Staff told us  that the service provided regular training, delivered face-to-face or online to ensure that skills and  knowledge levels were maintained. Examples of recent training included health and safety, fire training, first  aid, safeguarding, medication, dementia and mental capacity. Newer staff members outlined the induction  process that they completed, including mandatory training modules which followed Care Certificate  standards, home induction and shadowing experienced staff. The Care Certificate is a national standard of  minimum training topics for staff that are new to adult social care environments.  9 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  The  service maintained well-documented evidence of staff supervision reviews and appraisals. We reviewed nine separate staff training files and the evidence from 2017. Each file contained a central planner showing  records of planned and actual performance reviews throughout the year. This showed that all staff had had  supervision reviews at least every two months including one annual appraisal. There were sections for each  member of staff in the supervision or performance review, with a separate sheet to record each review,  signed by both supervisor and supervisee. There was evidence of objective setting and discussion across a  range of topics relevant to the role. Appraisals included self-appraisal forms and personal development  along with training needs that had been discussed as relevant. One staff member said, ""We're encouraged  by the home to undertake extra training, such as a health care practitioner course."" Staff interviewed  confirmed that they received supervision every two months (or more frequently if needed) and said that they had opportunities to progress within the organisation if they wished and were encouraged to further their  training. This ensured a knowledgeable and skilled workforce at Sandown Park Care Home.    Each person's care file had a separate care plan for eating and drinking which covered information on  nutritional status with detail on any special dietary requirements such as a diabetic diet, need for pureed or  fortified food and any risks such as difficulty with swallowing. There was also a good level of detail on  preferences and routines, any food likes and dislikes and any allergies. For example, one person specified  that they preferred small portions, while others stated that they wished to have a hot drink before going to  bed at night. Any cultural requirements were noted, such as vegetarian food in some cases. There was a  dietary notification form in each plan which summarised nutritional and dietary needs with instruction to  forward a copy of the form to the kitchen for their records.  People's weight was monitored monthly along with malnutrition scores to indicate nutritional risks and  track any weight gain or loss over time. Where weight loss was noted we saw that more frequent weekly  weighing of the person was introduced. We saw evidence of referral to dietitians where there were concerns  and advice and recommendations were noted in the care plan and in the section of the care file which  recorded healthcare professional input. In some cases where it was felt necessary to monitor risk more  closely, daily food and fluid charts were introduced in the person's daily folder. We checked a sample of  these and they had been well maintained with targets for fluid intake and in one case a calendar to indicate  any days where fluid targets had not been met.  We observed plenty of food and drinks for people. There were easy-read menus people could use, but staff  plated food up and showed it to people so they could select based on the appearance and their preference.  Where one person could not state what they wanted, we saw a care worker say, ""How about ice-cream for  your pudding? I know you like ice-cream."" There were snacks and drinks throughout the day in both  communal areas and for people who liked to stay in their rooms.  There was evidence in all care files of liaison and correspondence with other agencies involved in the care  and support of people including hospital services, local authority assessments and reviews as well as  specialist input from a range of health professionals. Visits from health care professionals were recorded in a separate section of each care file and these were well-documented with details of the date of visit, any  relevant comments on advice given or follow up required. We saw good evidence of contacts with opticians,  dietitians, dentists, specialist nurses such as tissue viability, and details of hospital appointments and  relevant correspondence.   A local GP visited the service every week or as required for consultations with people or to conduct general  health or medication reviews. We saw that details of these visits were also recorded in a separate log kept in  the staff stations with a note of the date, symptoms and outcome for each person seen. GPs also recorded  details of ad-hoc visits in care files. We spoke to the GP whilst they were at the service. They gave very good   10 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  feedback about their connection with the service. They told us, ""I have nothing but praise for Sandown Park  Care Home."" The GP described that staff were pre-emptive in their monitoring and decision-making about  people's care, which reduced the burden on the doctor's surgery. The GP commented, ""They (staff) know the people well."" The GP described that together with the service, they had reduced or eliminated the use of  sedative medicines for people, replacing this with better management of behaviours that challenge.  Each care file contained a 'care passport' which contained a summary of the needs and risks relating to each person, categorised as 'things you must know about me' and 'things that are important to me'. This could be used if the person was admitted to hospital or transferred to another service.   The service provided a safe and hazard free environment for people to move around freely, with ample  space in corridors and communal areas for those with walking aids and wheelchairs. The service was very  well-appointed throughout with good quality modern furnishings and flooring in all areas. Bedrooms were  personalised with individual possessions and pictures and there were memory boxes with personal items  such as photographs and other memorabilia outside rooms on dementia units. Communal areas were  decorated and equipped for the needs and comfort of people living there, including those living with  dementia. Corridors had been decorated in bright colours with scenic murals and some sensory themed  wall hangings. There were separate activity rooms including a reminiscence room that had been decorated  in a comfortable and old fashioned style with armchairs, a fireplace and old style magazines and journals.  There was good signage throughout the premises with bedrooms, toilets and bathrooms clearly labelled  and there were clocks in communal areas for reference. The service had followed the best practise  guidelines published by the Kings Fund for older adults and those living with dementia.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the  service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to  deprive a person of their liberty were being met.  There were forms to evidence consent in all the care files reviewed. There was a new comprehensive  consent form used covering consent to care and treatment as outlined in the agreed care plan, consent to  access documentation as required and consent to photographs. The consent form had a section to indicate  whether the person had capacity to consent and if not whether consent had been sought from a power of  attorney, if appropriate or if there had been consultation with a relative. There was a section on the form for  a signed witness to give verbal consent if the person was unable to physically sign consent. Where there was  no capacity or others authorised to consent, there were best interest decision forms relevant to each  decision such as use of bedrails, providing personal care or administering medication.  There were mental capacity assessment forms in relevant people's care files and these had been well  completed in each case, using the correct two stage test required by the MCA. Where a person lacked  capacity there were appropriate forms to document best interest decisions that showed involvement and  consent of relatives or others relevant. Where there was a power of attorney in place, this was recorded and  we saw evidence of the documents, as well as those from the Office of the Public Guardian. In one case there was a Court of Protection order in place and a copy of this was seen in the care file. There was evidence of  DoLS  applications and authorisations in care files where relevant and documentation seen was correctly   11 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  completed. Staff reported that they had received training in the MCA. All care staff demonstrated good levels of knowledge and understanding of the MCA and the key principles involved. All were able to clearly explain  the definition of mental capacity and the implications for care if a person lacked capacity, such as helping  people to make decisions and choices as far as possible using suitable language and alternative ways of  communicating such as signing, facial expressions or visual aids.  12 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service continued to provide outstanding care, formed compassionate relationships with people and  supported family members of people who were connected with Sandown Park Care Home. People and  relatives told us the service ensured they were treated with kindness and respect. People provided positive  feedback. Comments included, ""They will bring me anything I ask for"", ""Staff are kind and caring when they  are moving or helping me"", ""Oh yes, staff are always very pleasant. I know if I needed to complain they would listen"", ""They do their best"", ""Helpful and lovely"", ""They let me do whatever I want. I come back to my room  (whenever I want)"", They are very good; always attentive and helpful"", ""They (the staff) have excellent  qualities and understanding"", ""Very attentive and polite at all times"", ""Kind, caring, friendly happy"" and  ""They are doing their jobs to the best of their abilities. Very polite.""  We observed good evidence of gentle and unhurried care throughout our inspection with staff providing  appropriate and attentive care to people who used the service. Staff demonstrated that they were familiar  with people's needs and routines and knew how to support and communicate with them. In one case we  saw a member of staff conversing with a person in a different language. Although the person could speak  English, they liked to speak in their native language and staff respected the person's preference. We  observed that care staff were attentive and careful when they assisted people to move around the service  and were prompt to attend to call bells or other requests for assistance. We observed that people were  offered choices about what they wished to do or what they wanted to eat and staff were careful to allow  people time to express themselves.  The Accessible Information Standard is a framework put in place from August 2016 making it a legal  requirement for all providers to ensure people with a disability or sensory loss can access and understand  information they are given. People's support plans included extensive information about how to effectively  communicate with them. We observed many staff could speak languages other than English. Staff  conversed with one person in Italian and another person in Spanish. Throughout the building, there was  evidence information in English was translated into several other languages. Staff told us they used the  signage to help communicate with people. Staff could recite different food and fluids in other languages.  The service ensured that people had access to the information they needed in a way they could understand  it and were fully compliant with the Accessible Information Standard.   People and relatives were actively engaged in the day-to-day operation of the service. There were regular  'residents and relatives' meetings and surveys to gain people's opinions about care. One person told us, ""I  would most certainly recommend the home based on the way they have rallied around my situation."" A  relative told us, ""I have been to one relatives' meeting and have had a written survey."" Other comments  included ""They listen to any views"" and ""I have been to a relatives' meeting and any issues are dealt with. ""I  never felt we needed to keep watching."" There were no restrictions to visiting hours and people could have  small gatherings for special events. The service could provide catering as requested by the person or family,  so that memorable events were created. Staff often took photos of people's events (with their consent), so  they could reflect back on good times they had enjoyed. Print outs of the photos were provided to people  and relatives which could be used for reflection and reminiscence.  13 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  Care plans were person-centred and recorded a good level of detail in relation to people's preferences and  routines. Consent documentation and care plans showed extensive evidence of consultation and input from people living at the service and their relatives. Each care file contained a section on life history which  recorded details of past occupations, family and significant events. They had a good level of detail to add  colour and interest to the care plan. There was a form in the care file to record contact with relatives. It was  clear from contact sheets in some files that there was regular communication between the home and family  members.  We observed that staff checked on people's well-being throughout the day. As people moved about the  premises, staff greeted them and asked them how they felt. We noted on several occasions that staff  members asked if there was anything a person needed. During times when people did not wish to be  disturbed, such as when they were in a bedroom or alcove lounge, staff respected their freedom but  maintained a visible presence if the person needed something. We observed that people enjoyed starting  conversations with staff and engaging with them. We saw people laughed and smiled when they were  talking with staff. This demonstrated people had developed positive relationships with the staff team. We  also observed that staff allowed people to perform tasks for themselves, and only offered assistance in the  least way possible. This ensured that maximum independence was encouraged and people could remain as active as possible in their own care.  People's privacy and dignity was protected and promoted. Staff described the methods they used to ensure  that they respected people's privacy and dignity such as closing doors and curtains when delivering  personal care and ensuring that people were covered up as far as possible. We observed that people's doors were closed when staff were in the room to provide care. We also noted staff knocked on closed doors  before they entered and announced their arrival and asked permission if a person's door was open. Signs  were used on the outside of bedrooms doors to indicate that privacy was requested, so that people and staff were not disturbed during intimate personal care activities.  Confidential information about people who used the service and staff was protected. At the time of the  inspection, the provider was registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The Data  Protection Act 1998 requires every organisation that processes personal information to register with the ICO  unless they are exempt. We found the service complied with the relevant legislative requirements for record  keeping. People and staff's confidential information was protected.  14 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service continued to provide outstanding person-centred care. The registered manager and deputy  manager led the service by example. They placed people, relatives, visitors and healthcare professionals  before themselves. During our inspection, they excused themselves at times to attend to people or engage  with relatives they saw, which demonstrated their commitment to a welcoming, attentive service. When we  observed the interaction between managers and staff, we saw joined-up working, excellent team thinking  and a positive workplace culture. Staff told us they were happy to work at the service and felt connected to  people. People and relatives had provided 41 written compliments and positive feedback in one year.  People and relatives felt staff extensively knew them and the care requirements. The service's focus on  people had ensured care experiences were tailor-made and unique care was provided to each person.  We noted people's apartments were very nicely decorated to their choice. They told us they were able to  have their own furniture and belongings, and we observed the room was laid out in accordance with how  the person liked it. One person was emphatic that we viewed their bedroom. The room, walls and floor were  covered with family photos and celebrities. The person repeatedly remarked on how they were allowed to  put up all their photos and cuttings. The person told us they liked that the service had accommodated their  request, despite any damage that there may be to the premises by gluing and sticking items down.  People continued to have a very active social life. There was a special focus on people who were less  ambulant or were living with dementia. One activities coordinator, a specialist in dementia-friendly activities and reminiscence, was instrumental in putting together the 1940's themed sitting room. This was still well- used by people, who enjoyed the experience. The expansive sensory garden created by the activities team  continued to be regularly used, was wheelchair friendly and hosted multiple community get-togethers since  our last inspection. There were raised garden beds, tactile stimulating plants, bright coloured displays of  flowers and ornaments and areas where scented plants could be touched and used. The registered manager told us that both the garden and the service were nominated for the 2017 national dementia care awards.  The service and the garden were demonstrated as having a positive effect on people's physical, emotional  and mental wellbeing. We viewed the article about the impact in a journal and via other media. The  activities coordinator told us use of the garden would be further expanded in the warmer seasons. This was  to include informal dining in a casual sun-loving atmosphere.  One activities coordinator told us they used research and best practise to guide the type of programme that  was developed. The service has subscribed to a specialist dementia care magazine, showcased activities  that were different, unusual or newly tested. We could see some of the ideas were taken from the magazine  and put in place at the service. For example, one alcove in a corridor had been transformed into an indoor  garden. Two seats were available for people to sit down and look at, touch and smell the plants. A large  mural in the alcove depicted the outside world. We saw many people stop on their way in the hall, and sit  down to interact with the garden. One person told us they ""liked"" the garden alcove as they found it hard to  go outside.   Since our last inspection, the complete care documentation system was replaced by more robust and   15 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  detailed tools. These provided an even clearer picture or story about each person and how they liked to live  their life. Care plans however remained person-centred with information on routines and preferences as well as detail on any cultural, ethnic or religious requirements. Attention was given to activities of living which are often overlooked in older people's care, such as waking and night routines, preferences at the end of life,  clothing style and personal care preferences. People's preferred names were clearly noted at the front of the care plan as well as any preferences for the gender of care staff. We observed staff call people by their  preferred name throughout our inspection.  People's care documentation was holistic and successfully reflected each aspect of their life. Care files  contained a profile of the person with key details at the front of the file, including a photograph, date of  birth, admission, preferred name, contact details for relatives and next of kin, preferred GP, medical profile  and background, and any allergies. There were individual care plans for personal care, diet and weight,  mobility, moving and handling (including a falls 'diary'), memory and orientation, medicines, social contact  and recreational activities, eyesight, hearing, oral healthcare, podiatry, communication, skin care and  continence. There were monthly evaluations of each care plan carried out by nursing or other senior staff  and most were up-to-date, with a good level of detail. More detail would be added as staff became more  familiar with the provider's new care documentation.  When we reviewed the Provider Information Return (PIR) before our inspection, we saw the service had an  exceptionally low incidence of wounds such as bruising, skin tears and pressure ulcers. We also noted when  the service admitted people from nearby hospitals they were often able to completely heal pre-existing  chronic wounds and pressure ulcers. Where people had wounds or pressure areas these were documented  in separate section of the care file with a realistic wound management plan, wound assessment charts, body maps and details of any specialist input. For example, there was evidence of community healthcare  professional advice from the tissue viability nurse that provided advice on cleaning, dressing and bandaging as necessary.   Extensive daily records of people's support and monitoring charts were maintained by care workers. There  was a separate folder for each person containing daily charts such as personal care records, food and fluid  records (if necessary), re-positioning charts, topical creams records and night checks. These were up-to-date and correctly completed with records of when people had had showers or refused personal care. There was  a separate care plan for social contact and activities within the care file which outlined which activities were  preferred, level of engagement and in some cases, whether people preferred not to engage in group  activities. A separate activities folder was maintained on each floor with a section for each person  containing a daily activity log to record their participation in various activities or other social engagement.  People were provided with service guides which contained key information about various aspects of  Sandown Park Care Home. This included how to raise a concern or make a complaint. In addition,  information was available in the reception area of how to report issues concerning care, accommodation or  other matters. We saw the service had a satisfactory complaints policy and we looked at the complaints  folder. We saw the registered manager dealt with any recorded concerns or complaints promptly and  outcomes and actions were recorded. The registered manager was knowledgeable about their role in  complaints management. There was a low rate of complaints about the service or care, and all of the  complaints received were resolved.   The service regularly provided end of life care. There was a separate care plan in each file for people's end of  life preferences. The level of detail varied depending on individual requirements but resuscitation wishes  were correctly recorded and there was information on any funeral arrangements, family contacts, religious  or spiritual requirements. We saw the use of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)   16 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  guidance was used in palliative care plans. For example, there was an end of life checklist including relevant  aspects of care such as maintaining hydration, promoting dignity and anticipatory prescribing of medicines  for support and comfort. We saw end of life practice occurred during our inspection, with a vicar visiting and  supporting grieving family members and staff. A relative of the person approached us to provide their  opinion of the care, despite the difficult circumstances. They wanted us to know how the staff and service  had respected the person's and family's wishes, which resulted in a peaceful, pain-free death.  Where a 'do not resuscitate' decision was made in advance with the person and their family, the service  ensured the relevant forms were located near the front of care files. We saw they included advice from  multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. All were completed on original, legally valid forms and had been  completed, authorised and dated by the GP. At the time of the inspection, 95% of people who used the  service had made a definitive decision about their resuscitation preferences.  17 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service's management and care team were outstanding. People and relatives described a very well-led  service. One person said, ""Very good (staff); everyone works well together."" Another person described the  registered manager. They told us, ""On the whole, she (the manager) is marvellous. She takes an interest and  helps out when needed. She is very approachable."" A further person we asked about the management said,  ""She (the manager) is very nice. Comes in now and again (to the person's room). Heavens yes, well-run. They all do their best."" Other comments we received included, ""She (the manager) is polite"", ""The manager is very  approachable. She took time to sit down with me and suggested ways forward. In fact, everyone has been  extremely polite and caring"", ""Let us say manager is on hand and you can go and talk to her. She is visible"",  ""We can't fault it. Everyone works together. There is a good environment. The manager is pretty good; fair  but assertive"" and ""I like the fact that the manager has an 'open door' policy and is always available.""  Staff sentiments echoed those of people who used the service and their relatives. One staff member said,  ""The manager is very helpful."" Another staff member told us, ""The manager is fantastic, very supportive,  always approachable. I can't compliment her enough."" Other staff commented, ""The management here is  very good. They know we work hard and show they appreciate us"" and ""The manager is very supportive and  very flexible with her staff if they need time off in an emergency."" Staff stressed that there was very good  communication between senior staff and those on individual floors with a prompt response to any concerns or queries raised. One staff member said, ""There is very good communication from the manager. She's  around all the time and really takes care of her staff."" Another nearby staff member approached us and  stated, ""If anything is wrong the manager's door is always open. She always knows what's going on and is  always there to provide help."" A national staff recognition scheme had commenced to reward outstanding  talent in the workforce. The registered manager described that staff would be nominated based on going  above their role expectations for people's needs.  Staff reported that the registered manager and deputy manager were visible and accessible at all times,  including out of hours. They told us there were daily 'walkabouts' throughout the service. All staff felt that  senior staff were approachable and were confident that they could raise any concerns or issues and receive  a sympathetic and considered response. Staff said that there were regular monthly meetings on each floor  as well as whole service staff meetings, at which issues concerning the home, queries or concerns could be  raised and discussed freely. These were in addition to daily handover meetings where people's progress was discussed and any concerns addressed. Staff told us the deputy manager and registered manager  participated in these handovers so they knew the status of people's care. When asked, several staff claimed  that they would be happy for a relative to be cared for at the service.  There was a proactive, innovative way of tackling difficult issues at the service. An example was with one  person where the care needs were being skewed by an external source. Despite constant criticism and at  times upsetting behaviour, the registered manager and deputy manager acted professionally and in the  interests of the person. This involved working jointly with a healthcare professional, including participation  in legal processes to ensure the person received the best possible care. Another example was the detection  and management of one staff member whose behaviour fell well below the professional standards required.  18 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  The service ensured safety of all concerned. They sent the staff member home in a taxi, checked people's  medicines, made a detailed report of the issue and referred the matter to a professional body. Via our  monitoring processes, we could see the wider public were protected from poor care practices by the action  the service took in relation to the single incident.  The service repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to quality care. The service had built strong and  reliable connections with the local community and multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. Examples  included the fortnightly pre-schoolers' visits with people who used the service. We heard that children and  people had engaged positively during the 'army wives' visits (a similar earlier project with children). People,  relatives and staff told us they ""loved"" having the children at the service. The children would sit with people  and talk to them, participate in activities together and ask questions of each other.   The service continued their commitment to research in the adult social care landscape. Since our last  inspection, the service had continued one project called 'care companion'. A unique system, designed in  England but piloted only at Sandown Park Care Home, staff used portable handsets to log hourly  information about each person. This included indicators such as a person's emotion, pain score, skin  integrity, hunger and thirst. The data was analysed by the computer to provide a baseline score of the  person's needs, and provide real-time monitoring which could be accessed by relatives from their home  computers or personal mobile phones. The intuitive system was able to determine when deterioration of a  person's condition was imminent, and send warnings to the staff. Staff could then reassess a person, call the GP for simple advice and prevent avoidable hospital admissions. The clinical commissioning group (CCG)  representative told us although the project had ended and the impact for people was extremely beneficial,  the service had decided to continue to use 'care companion'.   Another example of research was the probiotic study. Probiotics are natural bacteria that live in a person's  stomach and intestines. Only 20 care homes in England and Wales were selected to participate. The trial was to determine whether a daily capsule of probiotics would reduce the rate of chest infections, skin problems,  diarrhoea or constipation and mouth disorders. Fourteen people who used the service took part. Staff were  trained as 'champions' for the project and taught the remainder of the team the purpose and potential  benefits of the study. The staff then ensured adherence to the study protocols and documentation  requirements. Although the research was not complete, the results would be used to determine whether  there was a benefit for people who took daily probiotics. The information from the study would also be  published nationally and internationally for healthcare professionals to use in their own services.  The service had continued to use the CCG's 'hydration project' initiative. There is evidence that people who  drink more fluids have a decreased risk or development of urinary tract infections. Staff were appointed as  'champions' to ensure the principles of the hydration project were embedded to benefit people. These  included at least seven dedicated drinks rounds per day, frequent encouragement for people to take fluids  and additional support for people who needed help with drinks. We consistently saw people enjoying  drinks, and drinks offered to people. Some people had their favourite cups, including ones with movie  characters on the outside which could hold large volumes of fluids. The 'hydration stations' (fluid trolleys)  were brightly coloured and decorated in a Tropicana theme. We saw this included palm trees and flamingos. A large range of drinks was available for people, including fizzy waters and traditional flavours from the  1900's. We saw evidence that people did not develop urinary tract infections and communicated regularly  with the CCG to track their progress.  There was an underlying equality policy and procedure which staff were aware of. The provider also clearly  displayed this on their website and showed the principles they subscribed to. People were respected by staff regardless of their cultural, religious, or linguistic backgrounds. People's characteristics were protected by   19 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  staff and the management team. The registered manager also told us the principles applied to the  workforce and we observed this. Staff treated each other with respect and dignity. The kitchen staff had an  excellent knowledge of special dietary requirements and staff knew specific end of life regimes for different  cultures or religions. The service respected people's and visitors' gender and sexuality choices. Additionally,  the service had recently commenced a scheme with a European charity to offer work placements to younger adults with disabilities. The service had thoroughly assessed and implemented the principles of equality,  diversity and human rights in the provision of care and its daily operations.  A number of quality audits and checks were used to gauge the safety and quality of care. These were  completed according to an audit calendar set by the provider and included assessments from the service's  staff and management, regional support team, contractors and community healthcare partners. We saw  areas that were audited included the kitchen, laundry, maintenance and repairs, medicines, infection  prevention and control, staff training and recruitment, personal care and nursing documentation. The  calendar clearly set out who was responsible for each audit, and what month the check was to be  completed in. We reviewed some of the audits which were completed. There was a key performance  indicator report completed monthly aligned with criteria from the Care Quality Commission's five 'key  questions' The report populated an action plan which was required to be completed by the registered  manager. We saw any areas identified for improvement were always reviewed, and closed off with a  signature of the responsible staff member and the date.  There were times when the service was legally required to notify us of certain events which occurred. When  we spoke with the registered manager, they were able to explain the circumstances under which they would  send statutory notifications to us. We checked our records prior to the inspection and saw that the service  had notified us of relevant events. The service's prior inspection rating was clearly displayed in the reception area and on the provider's website.  20 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  "

People in care homes receive accommodation and  personal care as single package under one contractual agreement. CQC regulates both the premises and the care provided and both were looked at during this inspection. The care home accommodates 12 people in  one adapted building.   The inspection took place on 30 January 2018 and was unannounced. At the previous inspection in January  2016 we identified one breach of regulations relating to 'Good Governance. ""Following the last inspection,  we asked the provider to complete an action plan to show what they would do and by when to ensure  compliance with the regulations.   At this inspection we found issues remained with the organisation, presence and relevance of  documentation.  Although we did not identify any significant risks to people, if appropriate and robust  documentation is not maintained there is the risk of unsafe of inconsistent care delivery.    A registered manager was in place. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  The registered manager and provider were very 'hands on' and provided highly person centred care.  There  was a dedication to ensuring people had fulfilling lives and the best possible care and support experience.   However the 'hands on' nature of the registered manager was at the detriment to maintaining appropriate  documentation, with a lack of administration support to carry out these duties.  This lack of robust  documentation meant the service could not consistently evidence safe, effective care and a well led service,  despite some really positive feedback about the service from people, relatives and staff and positive  interactions observed during the inspection.   People were safe from abuse living in the home. People said they felt safe and safeguarding procedures  were in place to help protect people. Whilst the staff we spoke with had a good understanding of each  person and the risks they presented, this was not always underpinned by robust and up-to-date risk  assessments which increased the risk of inconsistent or appropriate care.   The premises was maintained to a high standard with very pleasant fixtures and fittings and a warm and  homely feel. Key maintenance checks were undertaken in most areas, although we identified some  concerns relating to fire safety which we referred to the Fire Service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. However protocols were required to support the safe and consistent use of ""as required medicines""  2 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  There were enough staff deployed to ensure people received prompt care and support. Staff had time to  spend with people as well as completing care and support tasks. Recruitment procedures were in place but  documentation did not always evidence some of the recruitment decisions made.   Staff knew people well and were knowledgeable about the topics and questions we asked them about.  However staff training was not well organised and we were unable to evidence staff had received training in  a number of areas.   The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  Where people lacked capacity, decisions were made in their best interest.  There  was a culture of seeking consent before any care and support interventions.    The service worked effectively with a range of health professionals to meet people's individual needs.   Technology was utilised to help ensure care needs were met.   People had access to home cooked food which they said was of high quality.  People had a range of choices  which were adapted to people's individual needs.   Staff were extremely kind and caring and treated people with a high level of dignity and respect. There was a pleasant , family like atmosphere within the home. Staff knew people very well and chatted to them  throughout the day.    People's views and opinions were respected and acted on. People had a say in what went on within the  home, including the food, activities and décor. People's independence was promoted and several people  helped out around the home in order to achieve this.   People's care needs were assessed and a range of plans of care put in place. Whilst we saw appropriate care  was provided to people, care plans did not always reflect people's current needs. People received kind and  compassionate end of life care.   People had access to a range of activities and social opportunities. The service supported people to go out  into the community and access events and community gatherings.   People and relatives displayed a high level of satisfaction with the service. They said the management team  were approachable and listened to any issues or concerns they had.   There was a positive and visibly person centred culture within the home with people, relatives and staff all  saying they would recommending the home to others.     Improvements were needed to governance systems to ensure the service achieved compliance with the  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Audits ,checks  and improvements plans needed putting in place to help achieve this.   We found two breaches of the health and social care act 2008 (Regulated Activities) 2014 Regulations. You  can see what action was asked the provider to take at the back of the full version of this report.  3 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  "	  The service was not consistently safe.   People felt safe living in the home. However care and support  was not always underpinned by relevant and up-to-date risk  assessments to help promote consistently safe care.  Systems  were in place to protect people from abuse.   Overall medicines were safely managed and people received  their medicines as prescribed.   There were enough staff deployed to ensure people received  personalised care and support and assistance when they  required it.  Improvements were needed to recruitment practice  as documentation did not demonstrate that safe procedures  were consistently followed.    	  The service was not consistently effective.   The service needed to ensure it worked to recognised guidance  and legislation.  Staff had an in-depth knowledge of people they  supported. However training records were not always present  which meant the service was unable to evidence that staff had  received training in a range of areas.   People spoke positively about the food provided by the home. It  was home cooked and adapted to people's individual needs and requirements.   The service worked with a range of health professionals to help  ensure people's needs were met.   The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental  Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  	  The service was caring.   4 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Good    Good    Requires Improvement    People and relatives provided very positive feedback about the  caring nature of the staff and owners. This was confirmed by our  observations.   Staff knew people very well and had developed good positive  relationships with them. People's independence was promoted  by the service.   Care was person centred and people's views and opinions were  used to plan people's care and support.   	  The service was responsive.  People received personalised care that met their individual  needs. Peoples were supported to follow their interests and  participate in activities in the home and the wider community.   The service utilised technology to enhance people's care and  support experiences.   People were very satisfied with the service, but mechanisms were in place should people wish to raise any concerns or complaints.   People received individualised and compassionate end of life  care.   	  The service was not consistently well led.   Documentation relating to people's care and support and  training was not kept up-to-date. Improvements had not been  made in this area following the last inspection.   There was a strong, visible person centred culture within the  home.  People , relatives and staff provided very positive  feedback about the home.   People's views and feedback was used to improve the service  and enhance people's care experiences.   5 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018     The Cedars  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in January 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 30 January and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two  inspectors. During the inspection we spoke with six people who used the service and six visitors. We also  spoke with three care workers, the registered manager and provider. We observed care and support,  including the mealtime experience and looked around the home. We looked at three people's care records  and other records such as medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training  records and maintenance records.   Because some maintenance records were not available to us on the day  of the inspection, we requested these were sent to us after the inspection. The registered manager  forwarded the required documents onto us.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health care professional who works with the  service.   On this occasion we did not request a Provider Information Return from the provider. This is information we  require providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the  service does well and improvements they plan to make  6 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were kept safe from abuse and improper treatment. People told us they felt safe living in the home.  They told us staff were kind to them and always treated them well. One person said ""I feel so safe and secure here. It's always nice and warm and staff do everything they should to make sure you are ok."" Another  person described the home as, ""Homely, warm and cosy."" A relative told us, ""It always feels so warm and  homely. It's a home not an institution."" Staff were able to tell us how they would identify and act on  allegations of abuse to help keep people safe. We saw there had been no recent safeguarding incidents,  however, our discussion with the registered manager demonstrated they had a good understanding of  safeguarding processes, giving us assurance the correct procedures would be followed should an incident  occur.  Where finances were held on behalf of people, records were kept to provide a full audit trail of any  income and expenditure to protect people from financial abuse.    Whilst staff had a good understanding of the risks each person posed and how to keep them safe, this was  not always underpinned by robust and up-to-date risk assessment documents. We observed staff were  vigilant in ensuring people remained safe. For example, we saw staff reminding one person who was  standing up to remember to use their mobility aid. They also prompted another person to put their slippers  on before standing up to ensure they were wearing appropriate footwear to help reduce the risk of them  falling. During breakfast we saw one person, who lived with dementia, reach for the teapot to pour  themselves a drink, staff reminded them to pick the teapot up by the handle because the teapot contained  hot tea. This showed us staff were mindful of ensuring they promoted people's independence and freedom  in a safe and supportive way. We saw evidence the service liaised with care professionals and obtained  specialist equipment when people's needs changed, for example, in relation to skin integrity and falls.   Risk assessment documents demonstrated that although risks to people's health and safety were assessed  they were not always kept up-to-date. For example, one person's mobility had reduced and they needed  two staff to meet their moving and handling needs, with specific equipment. Although staff were clear on the plan of care, there was an absence of formal risk assessment stating how this would be done safely. This  person's skin risk assessment and care plan had also not been updated to show they now spent most of  their time in bed.   Nutritional risk screening tools and care plans were not always kept up-to-date following changes in  people's weights and care plans contained a lack of information on the measures needed to promote good  nutrition.  Whilst we saw care practices had been adapted following changes in people's needs, the absence  of up-to-date formal risk assessments and care plans had the potential for inconsistent and unsafe care to  occur. It also meant there was a lack of evidence the risks associated with each person's care had been  formally considered and assessed.   The provider did not have Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) in place to instruct staff how to  safely evacuate people in the event of an emergency. Although staff knew people well, we were concerned  there were not appropriate processes in place to promptly and accurately inform the emergency services of  people's needs in the event of an emergency. The staff we spoke with told us they would check the fire panel  7 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  if the alarm sounded but could not tell us how they would tell the emergency services about people's needs  to ensure safe evacuation.  This demonstrated a lack of risk assessment in this area. Some fire maintenance  records were also not consistently in place. We made a referral to the local fire authority about these issues.   This was a breach of regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) 2014  Regulations.   We concluded there were enough staff to meet people's individual needs. People who used the service and  relatives told us staffing levels were appropriate, that they received prompt care and support and regular  interaction and companionship.  One person told us, ""Whenever I press my buzzer they are there like a  flash."" Another person told us, ""Staff are very attentive and come to you straight away if you ask for  something."" The registered manager told us the usual minimum staffing level were two carers during the  day and one carer at night. The registered manager lived above the home so were always on call and  regularly helped the care staff during the day. They also told us they were on call during the night and would  come down if the night carer required additional support. Care staff were supported by ancillary staff such  as the cook or cleaner. We observed care and saw people were provided with prompt assistance when  required. Staff had time to spend with people meeting their social needs as well as assisting with personal  care. We saw staff were unrushed and staff all told us there were enough of them to meet people's needs.   The registered manager told us they never used agency staff because they could not guarantee they would  work to the same high standards which they expected from their care staff. They told us unexpected  absences were covered by offering extra shifts to their regular staff. If staff could not pick up the shift then  they were always available and would work on the care rota. However, when we reviewed the care rotas we  saw that where the registered manager had worked a care shift they did not record this on the staff rota. This meant it was difficult to establish from reviewing the rotas that all care shifts had been appropriately  covered. We discussed this with the registered manager and they confirmed they would ensure a clear  record was kept of all care shifts they had worked so that they could appropriately evidence that  appropriate staffing levels had been maintained.   Overall, medicines were managed safely. Medicines were stored securely within locked cupboards and there was appropriate storage for controlled drugs. We observed a person centred approach to medicine  administration with senior care staff giving medicines to people at the times they required them. For  example, some people needed their medicines before food and arrangements were in place to ensure this  happened.  Medicine Administration Records (MAR) were in place which demonstrated people had received  their medicines as prescribed. Whilst we were able to account for most medicines, stock balances from the  previous month had not always been carried forward onto the current months MAR making reconciliation  difficult.  In addition, protocols were not in place for ""as required medicines"" such as pain relief instructing  staff on how to consistently offer these types of medicines. However, this risk was mitigated somewhat as  staff knew people well and how to identify if they needed these medicines. Safe arrangements were in place  for the application of topical medicines such as creams.   We saw a high standard of cleanliness throughout the home and we found no bad odours in any area. We  saw protective equipment was available and accessible to staff in key areas such as bathrooms and we saw  staff used these in an appropriate way to help reduce the spread of infection. We saw staff adhering to good  hygiene practices for example wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves and aprons  appropriately. A relative said, ""It doesn't smell its always as clean as you see it now.""  In November 2017, the  service had been awarded a five star rating for food hygiene by the Foods Standard authority, this is the  highest award that can be made and demonstrated food was prepared and stored hygienically.    8 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  Many of the staff employed had worked at the service for a number of years and there was therefore a low  turnover of staff. This meant people benefitted from consistent care from staff knowledgeable about their  needs and were able to build positive relationships with the people who cared for them.   We saw that the provider had undertaken checks to ensure the people they employed were safe and  suitable to work with vulnerable people. For example, they had sought references and carried out criminal  records checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to make sure the applicants did not have a  criminal conviction which may have made them unsuitable to work with vulnerable people. However, we  found the processes followed were not always appropriately recorded. We saw one staff member had a  previous conviction. The registered manager was able to describe in detail what measures they had taken to ensure this would not impact upon their ability to safely care for people. However, they had not completed a formal process to document their rationale and risk assess this situation prior to employing them. The  registered manager said they would complete a thorough risk assessment as an immediate priority.  This  was forwarded onto us after the inspection.   In another staff file we saw a character reference from someone the staff member had previously worked  with. However, there was no reference from their last employer. The registered manager told us they had  requested the reference several times but had no response from their last employer. This had not been  recorded within the person's recruitment file. This meant the provider was unable to demonstrate they  consistently followed safe recruitment procedures.    When we looked around we saw the home had safety features such as radiator coverings to protect against  the risk of burns and window restrictors to reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that  key safety checks such as the gas and electrical systems were carried out  However, the office where  information was stored was disorganised and therefore it was difficult to locate many of the maintenance  records we requested. These were all sent to us following the inspection.   Accidents and incidents were recorded and we saw evidence that action was taken including liaising with  health professionals and ordering equipment following incidents such as falls. When things went wrong  lessons were learnt for example we were told one person became stuck in the bath after the batteries on the  hoist ran out. We saw a new procedure had been put in place to reduce the likelihood this would re-occur.  The registered manager, owner and staff were committed to improving people's experiences and taken  action to reduce the likelihood of adverse events.  9 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We found people's care needs were met by the service, this was achieved through close consultation with  people and their relatives and close monitoring of people's care experiences. However, the service did not  always seek and work to recognised guidance particularly in terms of ensuring the required documentation  and protocols were in place to underpin consistently safe and effective care.   We recommend the provider accesses guidance and support to help ensure they can evidence care is  consistently delivered in line with current legislation and evidence based guidance.   People provided excellent feedback about the staff who cared for them and said they were equipped with  the skills and knowledge to properly support them. Many of the staff had been at the service for several years and knew people very well. The registered manager was selective about the staff they employed to ensure  they worked to a consistent high standard. This helped ensure effective care.     Staff received a mixture of ongoing training including classroom training by external training providers,  online training and some hands on training delivered by the registered manager. However, we were unable  to evidence from the records available that all staff had completed appropriate training in key topics, such  as, safeguarding. Although the registered manager assured us that all staff completed regular training in  these areas and staff were able to talk speak confidently about these topics, we were concerned that  without an accurate and centralised training log the registered manager would be unable to effectively  monitor staff training. This issue had also been identified at the previous inspection.   This was a breach of regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act (2008) Regulated Activities 2014  Regulations.   New staff received an in house induction which included an overview of key internal policies and procedures such as fire safety and pressure area care. They also completed a number of shadow shifts until the  registered manager judged that they were competent to work independently. Staff who were new to care  were supported to undertake the Care Certificate. This is a nationally recognised training programme  designed to give staff new to care the knowledge and skills they need to deliver safe and effective care. We  spoke with a staff member who had recently completed this and they told us they found it a helpful  introduction to care. However, they said they found the 'on the job' training delivered by the registered  manager to be the most useful to ensure they could meet the individual needs of people who lived at the  home. They told us, ""They showed me precisely how to deliver appropriate personal care and pressure area  care to people. She taught me so much and how to ensure all the care we deliver is personalised to each  individual person's needs and requirements.""  The registered manager did not complete regular supervisions or appraisals with their staff. However, they  said they operated an open door policy where staff could come to them at any time to raise issues. They  also regularly worked alongside their staff on care shifts so explained they were able to monitor and address any poor quality care practices or training needs. This was confirmed by the staff we spoke with. One staff   10 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  member told us, ""You can go to the manager whenever you need anything, they will never turn you away or  make you feel like you are asking a stupid question."" Another staff member told us, ""I feel really well  supported, I don't have formal supervisions but I don't need one as I speak to [registered manager's name]  every day anyway and they always act on what I tell them or ask for.""  People who used the service and relatives provided good feedback about the food provided. One person  told us, ""The food is really good and excellent quality."" Another person told us, ""I am always full, we never go hungry, they are always trying to feed us."" A third person said ""The main meal is extremely good always fruit  and drink out and tea."" A relative said, ""The food smells beautiful and always looks nice on the plate."" All  food was home cooked by the cook or in the absence the provider assisted. People had a good choice of  food which rotated on a four weekly menu and individual requests were catered for. Food was fortified and  people were provided with additional snacks to maintain good nutrition.   We saw that mealtimes were a relaxed and social occasion for people. Staff were attentive to the little  details to ensure mealtimes were an individualised experience. For example, during breakfast everyone was  given several food options including hot and cold items, juices and hot drinks. Where people ordered hot  drinks we saw this was provided in an individual teapot with sugar and milk so the person could help  themselves. At lunchtime there was a lovely atmosphere with people talking amongst themselves and to  staff.   People's nutritional needs were assessed and staff were knowledgably about people's needs, although care  plan documentation and risk assessments did not always reflect this knowledge.  People were weighed  regularly, however, this information was not always used to update care plans. We saw one person had two  different weights recorded on the same day with no explanation within the records as to which one was  correct.   We concluded the service worked effectively with other healthcare professionals to help meet people's  needs.  People told us they could see a health professional whenever they wanted to. One person told us, ""If  I am unwell they take great care of you, they don't hesitate to call the doctor to make sure you get what you  need. I get everything I need living here and more."" A relative told us, ""They cope well with changes in needs  and getting the doctors involved."" They went onto say that contact with health professionals was ""very  good."" We spoke with a health care professional who said the service listened to their advice and contacted  them appropriate. They said they had no concerns over care at The Cedars.   Where people's needs had deteriorated and they needed more complex care and support for example with  moving and handling, appropriate professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists had  been contacted, although this was not always evidenced through care records. Relatives said they were kept informed and involved when people's needs changed.  The service was complaint with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DolS). The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making  particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act  requires that, as far as possible, people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed.  When they lack mental capacity to take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best  interests and as least restrictive as possible.   People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this is in their  best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care homes  and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  11 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. At the time of the inspection there  were no DoLS in place. One authorisation had expired and had been re-applied for within the appropriate  timescale but had not yet been reviewed by the supervisory body. The registered manager explained that  they had considered DoLS applications for others but many people had capacity to consent to their care  and support and they didn't believe the restrictions placed on others amounted to a deprivation of liberty  safeguards. However, this rational could have been better supported through care plan documentation.    We saw evidence people's relatives and health professionals were consulted over best interest decisions  and people were involved in decision making to the maximum extent possible. Staff explained choices to  people and waited for people's permission before proceeding with care tasks.  For example, prior to lunch we observed staff encouraging one person to go to the bathroom. The person  told them they did not want to go yet so staff left them for several minutes. When staff returned they asked  the person if they wanted to go to the bathroom yet and when the person said they were ready, staff  supported the person to stand and walk using their walking frame. Throughout this process staff provided  the person with appropriate encouragement, reassurance and explained each step so the person  understood what was happening. This demonstrated staff recognised the importance of consent.   The building was pleasantly decorated and finished to a high standard. People had been fully involved in  redecoration of the premises for example being consulted over the colour of décor and carpets. We  concluded the building was appropriately adapted for the needs of people using the service. The registered  manager demonstrated that as part of the pre-assessment process for new residents they thought carefully  about the building and its limitation in terms of space before determining whether they could meet any new  people's needs.    12 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People's feedback about staff was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone we spoke with told us staff were kind,  caring, friendly and compassionate. This extended to the provider and registered manager who were very  involved in providing care and support. One person told us, ""It's a home from home here. Staff treat you as if  you were a member of their own family. It's like a piece of heaven. I don't ever want to leave."" Another  person told us, ""It's one of the best places you could ever imagine, it's fantastic, wonderful."" A visitor told us,  ""The care people receive here is second to none, I would love to live here."" Another visitor said, ""Always feel  very welcome, lovely manner how the staff treat them."" A third visitor said, ""Friendly and well-mannered  staff, all staff nice."" A fourth visitor told us how impressed they were with the constant interaction between  staff and people which made for a friendly and family atmosphere.    People's views were also supported by our observations. Everyone was given a warm welcome as they  arrived in the lounge area in the morning.  We saw people received personalised care. For example, on the  day of our inspection it was a person's birthday. Staff had arranged for the hairdresser to come in to do their  hair. Staff really made a fuss of them when they came back from the hairdressers telling them how lovely  they looked. We could tell from the smiles and positive body language that this really made the person feel  happy. Staff also arranged a tea party so the person could celebrate their birthday with all the people who  lived at the home. Staff decorated the dining room and got out party plates, cups and serviettes to make the  event special. The cook asked the person if they wanted to come to the supermarket to choose the food  they wanted for their party. They said they did and went with the cook to choose exactly what they wanted.  There was a homely and relaxed atmosphere in the home. We observed lots of laughter and appropriate  and respectful fun and banter between people who lived at the home and staff. One person told us, ""Staff  are full of fun and keep us well entertained."" Another person told us, ""I don't normally like being away from  home for Christmas but I really enjoyed it here. Staff made it a real celebration.""  Staff were also complimentary about the quality of care provided. One staff member told us, ""The care  delivered here is really exceptional. I would be happy for any of my relatives to come to live here if they  needed to.""   Our observations and discussions with staff showed they knew people well and had developed strong  positive relationships with each person.  Staff had time to sit and chat with people, meeting their social  needs. However, despite having this knowledge we saw staff were mindful to promote people's individual  choice and independence. For example, during breakfast when staff offered people a choice they prompted  them with what the person usually enjoyed for breakfast but were also clear about what other options were  available on the menu. This helped people to make an informed decision about what they wanted to eat  that day. We saw people were able to do as they pleased. For example, they could get up and go to bed  when they wanted. One person said, ""You can do as you like, get up late and have a lazy day if you want.""   Another person told us, ""I like to go out for little walks as I love the fresh air, staff let me go out whenever I  like. They make sure I am ok and remind me to wrap up warm but I can go into town whenever I want to,  which is nice as that's something I have always liked to do.""  13 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We also saw that staff encouraged people to maintain their independence, for example, one person was  supported and encouraged to open their own post during our visit. Other people helped set tables and  assisted with the washing up.   People were encouraged to develop and maintain relationships. Visitors were able to visit the home when  they wanted and given a warm welcome with the offer of food and drinks. One person told us that their  partner visited twice a week and the home cooked meals for them so they could eat and spend time  together. Staff also supported people to attend hospital appointments if no family were available to take  them. This was done free of charge which demonstrated a caring service.   We also saw that staff spoke about this being a 'house' and were mindful to respect people's personal  space, privacy and dignity. For example, in the communal lounge we saw multiple examples of staff  encouraging people to be supported to go to the bathroom. This was always done in a discreet and  respectful manner.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the manager, staff, people and  visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service. The provider promoted a positive  and inclusive care ethos which put person centred care at the heart of care delivery. We saw staff were  focussed on empowering people to make decisions about their care. Adjustments were made to care and  support to cater for people's diverse needs, for example, ensuring appropriate equipment was in place to  help where people had a physical disability.   14 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives all praised the standard of care provided. They said it was of a consistently high quality  and met people's individual needs. A relative said , ""It's absolutely fantastic here. Superb, if I had to go to a  home I would come here, very homely."" Another relative said, ""Excellent care, more than happy with the  home, it's more like a family, they feed them and look after them.""  People told us the care delivered was highly personalised. One relative told us, ""It's the little things that staff  do which make all the difference. For example, they don't just dress people. They ask what they want to  wear and ensure the clothes are clean and co-ordinated. They are attentive to the little details like  remembering my relatives pearl necklace, earrings and helping to paint their nails. It shows the staff really  do care and take time to ensure each person feels special.""  Our observations confirmed staff had taken  their time and paid attention to detail when assisting people with their personal care.  We saw that people's  clothing was clean and co-ordinated and people had clearly been supported to brush their hair and clean  their teeth. Staff had also asked people if they wanted to wear their jewellery and made sure people's  spectacles were clean and reminded them to wear them. We saw one person was wearing an apron. We  asked them about that. They told us they were never without an apron when they were at home and that  they felt ""lost"" without it on. They told us staff had asked them if they wanted to wear their apron and  ensured it was regularly laundered.   Prior to admission, the registered manager completed an assessment to ensure they could meet people's  needs. They considered whether the home's environment, equipment and current residents were  compatible with the person's needs. People were invited to look around and join the other residents for a  meal if they wished to see if they liked the home. This allowed all parties to get to know each other and  make an informed decision as to whether the placement was right. This helped ensure people's needs could be met as soon as they moved into the home.    The service had recently moved over to an electronic care record system. We saw a range of care plans were  in place for areas covering communication, continence, personal care and skin integrity. These were subject  to updates, however, these were not consistently updated which meant they did not always demonstrate  the latest plan of care. Whilst this risk was mitigated somewhat by the small size of the service and  knowledge of staff, action was needed to bring these plans up-to-date.   People and relatives said they felt involved in care and support. We saw people and relatives were consulted on a regular basis for example if their needs changed and they needed specific equipment or interventions  from other healthcare professionals.    The service had utilised technology to help meet people's individual needs. The service used the  telemedicine scheme run by a local hospital trust. Telemedicine provides remote video consultations  between hospital nursing staff and the home. It helps support care outside hospital, including avoiding  unnecessary visits and admissions to hospital. A new electronic call monitoring system had been introduced which monitored response times and allowed management to review whether people were waiting long for   15 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  assistance. Assistive technology such as pressure mats were used to help reduce the risk of falls in the home. The manager told us they were planning to introduce voice recognition devices around the home to allow  people to have more control over their living environment, for example, allowing them to request certain  music to play. This was an excellent opportunity to involve people in how the home operated.    We saw staff regularly engaged people in meaningful and appropriate occupation. One person told us they  really enjoyed the entertainers who came into the home, particularly the singers and musicians. Another  person told us they had always enjoyed keeping the home clean and tidy. During the inspection we saw they spent some time in the kitchen helping staff to wash up. They told us this was something they really enjoyed  doing and helped to keep their ""mind active."" We also saw that during the afternoon staff got out a variety of games and puzzles which people played alongside whilst having a drink of sherry. People enjoyed playing  these and provided a good chance for staff, people and visitors to interact and have fun together. One  regular visitor told us, ""Staff go the extra mile to ensure they keep people really well entertained here.""  The service helped people maintain links with the local community. The provider took people out to the  shops and to local café's and the service assisted people attend community events. Nursery children visited  the home once a week to interact with the residents. People's spiritual needs were assessed and the service  worked with people to meet these needs. One person who had recently moved into the home told us staff  had supported them to attend a local Church. They told us their faith had always been a very important part  of their life and they were looking forward to being able to continually attend the local Church now that they lived at the home  None of the people who used the service, visitors or relatives told us anything negative about the service or  the standard of care provided. People said they would feel able to make a complaint if they had a concern.  They told us they would tell staff or the manager directly if they had an issue and were confident they would  be listened to. There was a formal complaints process in place which was provided to people when they  moved into the home as part of the service user guide. The registered manager told us they had not received any formal complaints from people who used the service or their relatives in the past 18 months.  A  significant number of compliments had been received by the home with people and relatives having  positive experiences of the service.   The service worked with other professionals to ensure people's end of life needs were met. We saw the  service worked with professionals to ensure anticipatory medicines were in place and some staff had  received training in end of life care. We spoke with two relatives about their experience of the care being  provided to their relatives as they reached the end of their lives. Both were positive. One told us, ""Staff are  really sensitive and so tender with my relative. They know it's a difficult time for us and make everything as  easy and compassionate as they can. We are so pleased we have found it here, the care is just excellent and  we know longer have to worry."" We spoke with a relative who said that the end of life care provided by the  home was attentive and to a high standard. However, care documentation detailing end of life  arrangements needed to be more robust.   16 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   Although we recognised the home was small and there was a high level of management presence;  documentation relating to people's care and support and the management of the service was not always  present or sufficiently robust. We did not find this impacted on people in a negative way, but there was a risk it would should robust risk assessments, care records and other systems not be maintained in the future.   Whilst the registered manager was open and honest with us and recognised improvements were needed to  aspects of documentation, the same issues were also present at the last inspection which demonstrated a  lack of action taken to act on risks that we previously identified.   For example, at the last inspection we found it was difficult to establish whether staff had received training  There was no collation of the training staff had received, and at times it was difficult to establish when staff  last had training updates in subjects. There was no defined policy or criteria for how often training updates  were required in various subjects, which had resulted in staff receiving updates at inconsistent intervals.  Training was not underpinned by any training needs analysis or formal assessment of staff skill.  This was  still the case at this inspection.   Care plans were not always reviewed and updated regularly which meant information within them did not  reflect people's current needs. There was no system to periodically audit and check care records to ensure  they were maintained to a high quality.  There was no overall system to monitor and check compliance with  the regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities 2014) Regulations.    Following our last inspection the registered manager had employed an administrative assistant to support  them to get on top of the paperwork. However, the administrator had left after four months because they  wanted to pursue an alternative career. Since then the post had been advertised but they had failed to find  the right person to fill the role. This meant the registered manager did not have additional support to ensure they kept on top of administrative tasks and record keeping particularly as they prioritised being 'hands on'  delivering care and support.   This was a breach of regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities 2014)  regulations.   A registered manager was in place. We found the required notifications had been submitted to us such as  any deaths which helped us monitor events occurring within the service. Feedback about the home and  quality of care provided was consistently good from people , relatives and staff. They all said they would  recommend the home to others. A staff member said it's a small friendly home,  I love it, you interact more  with people."" A person said of the provider and registered manager ""They are goodness of good, this place is marvellous. ""The feedback about the registered manager was overwhelmingly positive. One staff member  told us, ""I can approach [registered manager's name] about anything. I wouldn't hesitate to go to them if I  had a problem as I know they would act on it.""  17 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded that the registered manager had exceptionally high standards and promoted the ethos that  staff should always deliver high quality and personalised care. We noticed that staff did not call the service a  'care home' but referred to it as a 'house.' We asked staff about this. One staff member told us, ""We call it a  house because that makes you think that everything you do and the care you provide should be the same  high standards you would give to a member of your own family. We always treat people who live here as  family and respect that this is their home.""  The registered manager and owner were very hands on and this  combined with the small size of the home meant they had an in-depth knowledge of how the home  operated, people's needs and their likes and dislikes. This helped ensure a very person centred culture.  It  was clear they were very dedicated to ensure people's experience in the home was as positive as possible.   The provider sent out annual quality questionnaires to people who used the service and their relatives. We  reviewed the returned questionnaires completed by people in August 2017. All of the feedback provided was extremely positive and there were no suggestions about anything which people felt needed to change or be  improved. However, the registered manager said they reviewed every response and if there had been any  suggestions they would implement any suggested changes wherever possible.  The service sought people's  views and feedback in all areas of the home for example menu's were consistently revised based on  people's requests and their feedback about the food.  People were fully consulted over activities and new  décor.     For example, a new carpet was required in the lounge area.  People were asked what type of carpet they  wanted and they said they wanted an exact replicate of the current carpet. The provider and manager went  to some effort to source the same carpet taking samples to a number of shops.  This showed the service was  committed to acting on people's views and feedback.    We saw some evidence the service learnt from incidents and adverse events to improve safety and the  manager was dedicated to improving people's involvement and care experience for example through the  use of technology.  However, the service had not acted on our feedback following the last inspection and  needed to put in place management plans to improve its governance systems and processes.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including health and social care professionals to provide  appropriate care for people. We saw good relationships had been developed and maintained with these  professionals.   18 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

The inspection was unannounced on  the first day and announced on the second day. We previously inspected the service on 20 July 2016 and at  that time we found the provider was not meeting the regulations relating to safe care and treatment,  premises and equipment, and good governance. On this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made, however we found one new breach of the regulations.  The Lodge is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or personal care as a single package under one contractual agreement. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates both the  premises and the care provided, and both were looked at during this inspection.  The Lodge provides a service for up to seven adults who have a learning disability and behaviour that may  challenge others. The home provides accommodation and support over two floors; one floor for three men  and the other for four women. Bathroom and toilet facilities on each floor are shared. The home is close to  community facilities including, shops, cafes, a bank, post office and garden centre.   There was a registered manager in post who had been registered since January 2016. A registered manager  is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered  providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the  requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is  run.  Staff had a good understanding of how to safeguard adults from abuse and who to contact if they suspected any abuse.  Risks assessments were individual to people's needs and minimised risk whilst promoting people's  independence. Detailed individual behaviour support plans gave staff the direction they needed to provide  safe care.  Building maintenance and hygiene had improved and some areas of the home had been refurbished.  Safe recruitment and selection processes were in place. We reviewed the systems for the management of  medicines and found that people received their medicines safely.   Sufficient staff were deployed to provide a good level of interaction. The required number of staff was  provided to meet people's assessed needs, although one person, whose support needs had changed, was  unable to access the community on occasion while they were awaiting a re-assessment of their support  needs.  Staff told us they felt supported, however we found they were not always supported with regular   2 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  management supervision. Staff had received an induction and role specific training, which ensured they had the knowledge and skills to support the people who lived at the home.  People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported them in the  least restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service supported this practice, although some  best interest processes had not been evidenced.   People were supported to eat a balanced diet, and meals were planned around their tastes and preferences.  People were supported to maintain good health and had access to healthcare professionals and services.  They were supported and encouraged to have regular health checks and were accompanied by staff to  health appointments.   Positive relationships between staff and people who lived at The Lodge were evident. Staff were caring and  supported people in a way that maintained their dignity, privacy and diverse needs.  People were involved in arranging their support and staff facilitated this on a daily basis. People were  supported to be as independent as possible throughout their daily lives.  Care records contained detailed information on how to support people and included measures to protect  them from social isolation. People engaged in social activities which were person-centred.  Systems were in place to ensure complaints were encouraged, explored and responded to in good time and  people told us staff were always approachable.  People told us the service was well-led. The registered manager was visible in the service and knew people's  needs.  Records at the home could not evidence regular staff supervision was in place. This was the only breach of  regulation identified at this inspection, and showed that whilst much improvement had been made since  the last inspection, some concerns relating to governance remained.  Improvements had been made to oversight and audit within the service, although there were some recent  gaps.  The registered provider's system of oversight had not identified and addressed the problem we found with  staff supervision. Management input at the service had been reduced to three days a week in July 2017,  which appeared to have impacted on the sustainability of recent improvements in governance.   Feedback from staff was positive about the registered manager and they told us they felt supported. People  who used the service and their representatives were asked for their views about the service and they were  acted on.  We found one breach of the health and social Care Act (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. You can see  what action we told the provider to take at the back of the full version of the report.  3 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Good    Requires Improvement    Good    	  The service was safe.  Risk assessments were individual to people's needs and  minimised risk whilst promoting people's independence.  The building was maintained and managed in a safe way and  emergency plans were in place.  Medicines were managed in a safe way for people.  Staff had a good understanding of safeguarding people from  abuse.   	  The service was not always effective.  Staff did not always receive supervision and appraisal to support  their professional development needs.  Staff had received specialist training to enable them to provide  support to the people who lived at The Lodge.  People's consent to care and treatment was always sought;  however, some best interest decision-making had not been  recorded.  People were supported to eat and drink enough and maintain a  balanced diet. Healthy eating was promoted.  	  The service was caring.   Staff interacted with people in a caring and respectful way.  People were supported in a way that protected their privacy,  dignity and diverse needs.  People were supported to be as independent as possible in their  daily lives.  4 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  Good    Requires Improvement    	  The service was responsive.  People's care plans were person-centred and individualised.  People were supported to participate in activities both inside  and outside the service.  People told us they knew how to complain and that staff were  always approachable.  	  The service was not always well-led.  The service had improved since the last inspection, however a  new breach of regulation showed some issues with governance  remained.  The registered provider had an overview of the service, although  this system had not identified and addressed the issues we  found.  The culture was positive, person-centred, open and inclusive.  The registered manager was visible in the service and knew the  needs of people.  The registered manager used good practice and partnership  working in addition to audit to drive improvement at the home.  5 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017     The Lodge  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 11 and 18 October 2017 and was unannounced on the first day and  announced on the second day. The membership of the inspection team consisted of one adult social care  inspector and an expert-by-experience. An expert-by-experience is a person who has personal experience of  using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The area of expertise for the expert by  experience on this inspection was learning disabilities.  Prior to our inspection we reviewed all the information we held about the service. This included information  from notifications received from the registered provider, and feedback from the local authority safeguarding and commissioning teams. After the inspection we received feedback from two community health  professionals. The registered provider was asked to complete a Provider Information Return, however this  was not completed. This is a form that asks the provider to give some key information about the service,  what the service does well and improvements they plan to make.  We used a number of different methods to help us understand the experiences of people who used the  service. Some people communicated non-verbally and as we were not familiar with everyone's way of  communicating we used observation as a means of understanding their experience. We spent time in the  lounge areas and dining rooms observing the care and support people received. We looked in the bedrooms of four people who used the service. We spoke with five people and three relatives on the telephone. We  spoke with the registered manager, two senior support workers and two support workers. We looked at four  care records, four staff files, accident and incident records, medicines administration systems, maintenance  records and quality monitoring systems  6 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   	  Good  	"   People told us they felt safe at The lodge. One person said, ""I feel safe here and there are enough staff to  help me when I need them.""   Relatives we spoke with said, ""Yes, I feel my [relative] is safe at The Lodge. [My relative] seems a lot happier  when [they] come home nowadays, so that tells me that [my relative] is settling well there."" Another relative  said, ""I certainly do feel that my [relative] is safe there. I am not too sure about the staffing levels at the  moment as some have recently left due to the renovations. I think there are more agency staff on as a result  of this so I will reserve judgment on that question for the time being."" A third relative said, ""I feel my [relative] has changed so much for the better since being at The Lodge. [My relative] looks so much better in  [themselves] and is very happy with the staff and very happy with [their] housemates. We certainly think [my  relative] is safe living there.""  At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to safe care and treatment because some risks had not been identified so they could be reduced and  managed safely. We also found behavioural incidents were not always recorded and reviewed in order to  reduce incidents and keep people safe from harm. At this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made.  Systems were in place to manage and reduce risks to people. In people's care records we saw  comprehensive risk assessments to mitigate risks in relation to behaviour that may challenge others, self- harm, falls, choking, physical health, financial capability, decision making, refusal of medication, hot  weather, and transport. Risk assessments were detailed and contained clear directions for staff to ensure  risk was managed well. We saw these assessments were reviewed regularly and up to date. The members of  staff we spoke with understood people's individual abilities and how to ensure risks were minimised whilst  promoting people's independence. This showed the service had a risk management system in place which  ensured risks were managed without impinging on people's rights and freedoms.  Care plans and incident records showed physical intervention was only used as a last resort to prevent harm to the person concerned or to those close by. All such incidents were clearly documented and records  showed each incident was subject to senior staff review with any lessons learned translated into care plans.  Staff we spoke with were able to describe de-escalation techniques and how they minimised the use of  restraint.  Staff told us they recorded and reported all incidents and people's individual care records were updated as  necessary. We saw in the incident and accident log that incidents and accidents had been recorded and an  incident report had been completed for each one. Staff were aware of any escalating concerns and took  appropriate action. We saw the registered provider had a system in place for analysing accidents and  incidents to look for themes. This demonstrated they were keeping an overview of the safety in the home.  At our last inspection we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulations related to premises   7 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  and equipment because some of the systems in place to ensure maintenance and cleaning tasks were  completed were not effective. At this inspection we checked and found improvements had been made.  At the time of this inspection the home was being refurbished and improvements had been made to the  carpets, bathrooms, one kitchen and décor at the home. One extra bedroom had been completed on the  upper floor and a small office was awaiting decorating, which meant many records were being held next  door at a different home managed by the same provider.  The service was generally clean and odour-free, with some crumbs and debris on the upper floor prior to the cleaner completing their tasks there. The service employed a cleaner for communal areas and night staff  also completed cleaning tasks. We found cleaning schedules were now being followed, although the kitchen floor on the upper floor was sticky prior to the cleaner commencing. People were supported to clean their  own flats or rooms and there was a good supply of personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of  infections. Hand soap was not immediately available to staff throughout the home due to wall mounted  dispensers awaiting replacement. We raised this with the registered manager and she addressed this  immediately.  At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to safe care and treatment because people did not have personal evacuation plans (PEEP) in place. PEEPs  are a record of how each person should be supported if the building needs to be evacuated. At this  inspection we checked and found improvements had been made and people had a PEEP in place. Regular  fire drills were completed and people and staff were aware of the procedure to follow. This showed us the  home had plans in place in the event of an emergency situation.  We reviewed staffing levels at the service. At our last inspection on each night shift there was one waking  night staff member and one sleep in staff member. We found the member of staff on sleeping night duty was frequently woken due to the needs of people using the service. This meant they were more likely to be  working whilst tired and at risk of making mistakes. At this inspection we found improvements had been  made and the registered provider had changed the night staff rota so two waking night staff were on duty.  Most people and three out of four staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on duty. One staff  member felt more staff would enable them to take a person out whose behavioural needs had changed. The registered manager told us each person who used the service was allocated staff according to their assessed needs and we saw this was reflected in their care records and tallied with the number of staff on duty. We  observed there were appropriate staffing levels on the days of our inspection which meant people received  sufficient support, although one person was unable to go out as they were awaiting a reassessment of their  increased support needs in the community.  The registered manager told us she was currently recruiting for three new care staff members as some staff  had been moved to another service. The provider had their own bank of staff to cover for absence and asked regular bank staff to do extra shifts in the event of sickness, as well as using occasional agency staff. This  meant people were normally supported and cared for by staff who knew them well.  We reviewed the system used to support people with their medicines. Blister packs were used for most  medicines at the home, with some dispensed in bottles and boxes. We found all of the medicines we  checked could be accurately reconciled with the amounts recorded as received and administered. We saw a  stock check was completed three times a day and signed by two members of staff. Senior staff completed  weekly and monthly audits. This demonstrated the home had good medicines governance.  8 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  People's medicines, including topical creams, were stored safely in a locked cupboard in each person's  room or in the medicines room on the lower floor. Body maps were in place to guide staff where to  administer topical creams in the medicines records we sampled.   Staff we spoke with had a good understanding of the medicines they were administering and we saw  medicines being administered as prescribed. Medicines care plans contained detailed information about  medicines and how the person liked to take them, including care plans for medicines prescribed 'when  required', such as pain-killers. Having a 'when required' care plan in place provides guidelines for staff to  ensure these medicines are administered in a safe and consistent manner. This meant people were  protected against the risks associated with medicines because the provider had appropriate arrangements  in place to manage medicines.  The registered manager told us all staff at the home completed training in safe administration of medicines  every year and we saw certificates to confirm this. We saw staff competence in giving medicines was also  assessed regularly. This meant people received their medicines from staff who had the appropriate  knowledge and skills.  All the staff we spoke with demonstrated they understood how to ensure people were safeguarded against  abuse and they knew the procedure to follow to report any incidents. We saw safeguarding incidents had  been dealt with appropriately when they arose and safeguarding authorities and CQC had been notified.  This showed the registered manager was aware of her responsibilities in relation to safeguarding people at  The Lodge.  Staff knew the whistleblowing procedure and said they would be confident to report any bad practice in  order to ensure people's rights were protected. We saw information around the building about reporting  abuse and whistleblowing.  We saw from staff files recruitment was robust and all vetting had been carried out prior to staff working  with people. For example, the registered manager ensured references had been obtained and Disclosure  and Barring Service (DBS) checks had been carried out. The DBS helps employers make safer recruitment  decisions and reduces the risk of unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups. This showed staff  had been properly checked to make sure they were suitable and safe to work with people.  People who used the service, staff and visitors were protected against the risks of unsafe or unsuitable  premises. We saw evidence of service and inspection records for gas installation, electrical wiring and  portable appliance testing (PAT). A series of risk assessments were in place relating to health and safety.  9 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   Relatives told us they felt confident staff had the skills and knowledge required to support their family  members. One said, ""My [relative] is on a diet and The Lodge are good at helping [them] stay on it. [They  have] done well in keeping to it with help from the staff."" Another relative said, ""They support [my relative] to hospital and for other appointments. [Another relative] goes along too and gets on well with the staff and  thinks they do a good job too.""  Staff we spoke with told us they felt appropriately supported by managers and had supervision every three  months or so, an annual appraisal, and regular staff meetings.   Regular supervision of staff is essential to ensure people are provided with the highest standard of care. We  looked at four staff supervision records and found not all supervision was delivered in line with the  registered provider's policy of two monthly. For one staff member there was no record of supervision in 2016 and only an ad hoc supervision around the specific issue of cleaning in March 2017. A second staff member  had no supervision in their records between September 2016 and October 2017, with the exception of an ad  hoc supervision around the specific issue of food hygiene in December 2016. Neither had an annual  appraisal completed. Following our inspection the registered manager sent us a record of supervision for  the second staff member from May 2017, which still left a gap of five months. This showed staff were not  always receiving regular management supervision to monitor their performance and development needs.  This was a breach of regulation 18 (2) (a) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014.  The registered manager told us she was aware of gaps in supervision and appraisal for some staff and  showed us the supervisions they had planned in October and November 2017. A recent senior staff meeting  record showed senior staff had been asked to add supervision dates to the staff rota.  We saw evidence in staff files to show new staff completed an induction programme when they commenced employment at the service. Staff told us they completed e-learning and face to face training and then  shadowed a more experienced staff member for up to a month if needed. The shadowing focused on getting to know people's individual needs and preferences. A new staff member told us they had been allocated a  learning buddy, who showed them around and provided support. We saw new staff also completed the Care Certificate. The Care Certificate is an introduction to the caring profession and sets out a standard set of  skills, knowledge and behaviours that care workers follow in order to provide high quality, compassionate  care. This demonstrated new employees were supported in their role.   Staff were provided with training and support to ensure they were able to meet people's needs effectively.  We looked at the training records for four staff members and saw they had completed training in areas such  as, infection prevention and control, first aid, food hygiene, autism awareness, Mental Capacity Act 2005  (MCA) and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS), and safeguarding adults. Staff told us and we saw from  records they also completed three days of face to face training in preventing and managing behaviour that   10 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  challenges, and this was updated annually. Staff told us they were supported to update their training and  complete nationally recognised level two and three qualifications in health and social care. The training  matrix showed which staff had undertaken training and highlighted training that was due to be refreshed  and we saw certificates in staff files to confirm the relevant training had been completed. This demonstrated people were supported by suitably qualified staff with the knowledge and skills to fulfil their role.  The MCA provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the  mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible, people make their own  decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to take particular  decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as possible.  People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this is in their  best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care homes  and hospitals are called DoLS.   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. Six people were subject to DoLS  authorisations, some of which had conditions attached, and one person had been assessed as having the  mental capacity to decide to live at the home.  Staff at the service had completed training and had a good understanding of the MCA. One staff member  told us about one person, who had been assessed as having mental capacity to choose to go out alone.  They said staff could explain the risks but if they chose to go they could not stop the person, as they  understood the risk and could make their own decisions. The service had also requested a mental capacity  assessment and best interest discussion with the person's social worker, to ensure the person understood a  particular decision related to their visits to a friend's house, and to ensure appropriate decision-making  support and information was provided for the person.  It was clear from observations people's autonomy, choices and human rights were promoted. We saw in the  care records we sampled mental capacity assessments had been completed for people in relation to the  decision to live at the home, the administration of medicines, and the decision to accept personal care. We  saw examples of good practice in mental capacity and best interest processes where representatives had  been consulted in relation to health interventions, restrictions in a person's diet due to health conditions,  and whether to reduce or stop smoking.  Two people's mental capacity assessments stated they lacked capacity to consent to the administration of  their medicines by staff, however there was no record of their representative being consulted in their best  interests and the assessment was signed by the registered manager only. The registered manager told us  this decision had been discussed with people's representative and they would record best interest  discussions with the person and their representative to evidence this.   People at The Lodge were supported to have sufficient to eat and drink and to maintain a balanced diet.  One person said, ""I like the meals that I get here. I get a choice if I don't like something.""  A relative said, ""My [relative] enjoys the food. [My relative] prefers home cooked food to takeaways. The  Lodge does provide for [my relative's] religious needs though."" Staff told us they cooked the main meals and some people who used the service joined in with preparation.  Some people were able to help themselves to a drink or a snack, whilst others needed careful monitoring of  all dietary in-take due to health conditions.  11 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  Meals were planned around the tastes and preferences of people who used the service. Each person had a  list of food likes and dislikes in their care records, which was used to inform meal planning. We saw the  individual dietary and cultural requirements of people were catered for, for example, one person was living  with diabetes and one person required specific food-stuffs to meet the requirements of their faith.    Meals were recorded in people's daily records. This included a record of all food consumed, including where  food intake was declined and details of the food eaten, although there were some minor gaps in recording.  People were weighed regularly to keep an overview of any changes in their weight and we saw action was  taken if there were any changes. This showed the service ensured people's nutritional needs were  monitored and action taken if required.  Kitchen refrigerator temperatures were higher than recommended on the two days prior to our inspection  and the action taken to reduce these had not proved effective. The registered manager told us she was  trialling a system recommended by their estates advisor to use bottled water to check fridge temperatures,  however the recorded temperature remained above that recommended, even though in one refrigerator the bottled water had iced up. The registered manager told us she would continue to liaise with their estates  team to find an effective system to ensure fridge temperatures were within recommended limits and  purchase new equipment if required.  People had access to external health and care professionals as the need arose. On the first day of our  inspection one person was supported to attend a hospital appointment and another person was visited by  an independent mental capacity advocate. Staff said people attended healthcare appointments and we saw from people's care records a range of health professionals were involved. This had included GPs,  psychiatrists, community nurses, chiropodists, dentists, speech and language therapists, and psychologists.  People also had an up to date health action plan in their care records and a hospital passport. The aim of a  hospital passport is to provide hospital staff with the information they need to know about a person with a  learning disability when they are admitted to hospital. This showed people received additional support  when required for meeting their care and treatment needs.  The atmosphere of both floors of the home was comfortable and homely. There were pictures and  photographs in the communal areas. Maintenance tasks had been completed since the last inspection and  further work was planned. This meant the design and layout of the building was conducive to providing a  homely but safe and practical environment for people who used the service. Some areas were in need of  updating, for example, the kitchen on the upper floor was in need of refurbishment and this had been  flagged up with the registered provider on regular maintenance audits to promote the dignity of people  using the service. The registered manager told us she hoped this would be replaced in the near future.   12 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us the staff were caring. One person said, ""I like it here."" Another person said, ""The Staff are kind  to me. They are taking me to see my [relative] today. They talk nicely to me as well.""  One person's relative we spoke with said, ""The staff seem caring. They regularly ring, even if there's just a  sign of a problem."" Another relative said, ""I've met almost all of the staff and they all seem nice. They must  treat [my relative] well because [my relative's] behaviour has improved so much and that is the first place we see it if [they aren't] happy, or they weren't looking after [my relative] properly."" A third relative said, ""The  staff are very, very nice. They are extremely pleasant. My [relative] loves their room and we have nothing but  praise for The Lodge and its staff team.""  One person told us they did not like living at the home and wanted their own flat. We saw from records this  had been explored with the person in conjunction with community professionals. They also chatted about  all the things they enjoyed doing with staff at the service and clearly had a good relationship with the staff,  who showed empathy with their situation.  Positive caring relationships were developed through staff understanding people's needs and their  personalities. It was clear from our discussion with staff they knew all about the people they supported and  enjoyed supporting them. One staff member said, ""Yes I like it. I enjoyed going abroad with [name of  person]. It was lovely to be able to do that with [person]."" Another staff member said, ""I love it."" And a third  staff member said the best thing about the service was, ""These guys [who live here]"" A fourth staff member  said, ""Yes I enjoy it. Making residents happy. The residents are all happy. Even [name of person] on a good  day. They all like living here. The residents give you a hug.""  People told us they had been consulted about the care provided for them and we saw staff asked  permission before delivering care. People or their representatives were involved in care planning and  reviews where possible and staff used their knowledge of peoples' individual preferences to plan their  support.  There was a friendly and homely atmosphere and some people enjoyed banter, chatting, laughing and  singing with staff. Staff spoke with people respectfully, as equals and people were included in conversations  and discussions.  Staff were respectful of people's privacy; they knocked on people's doors and asked permission to enter.  Staff told us they kept people covered during personal care and ensured doors and curtains were closed.  People wore clothes and accessories in keeping with their personal style and preferences and staff  complemented them on their appearance or clothing to promote self-esteem.  People were supported to make choices and decisions about their daily lives. Staff used speech, gestures,  sign language, photographs and facial expressions to support people to make choices according to their  communication needs. Information was presented in easy read formats to promote good communication,  and care plans contained details of how to recognise when a person was unhappy or happy using non-  13 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  verbal cues. One staff member said they showed people food items from the kitchen to support them to  choose what they might like to eat.  People's individual rooms were personalised to their taste, for example people had their personal items,  photographs, DVDs and games arranged in a way they liked and had chosen their own bedding and wall  colour. Personalising bedrooms helps staff to get to know a person and helps to create a sense of familiarity  and make a person feel more comfortable.   People were encouraged to do things for themselves in their daily life. We saw from records people took part in their laundry and cleaning their own rooms; they also helped to prepare snacks and drinks, and cook  main meals on occasion. Care plans detailed what people could do for themselves and where they might  need prompting or support. This showed people were encouraged to maintain their independence.   People's diverse needs were catered for and equality was promoted within the service. One person was  supported to take part in festivals with their family, as well as enjoying their cultural heritage.  Care plans showed people were supported with their gender and sexuality choices. We saw staff had  completed equality and diversity training and staff demonstrated an understanding of people's diverse  needs and personal preferences and the difficulties they may face in expressing these. Staff told us they  would respect people's diverse needs by ensuring they understood the person through their care plan,  talking with them or their families and supporting their cultural and personal life choices. Each of the care  records noted if people had a preference for the gender of the care worker who supported them. This  demonstrated the service respected people's individual preferences.  Staff were aware of how to access advocacy services for people if the need arose and some people had an  independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA). An advocate is a person who is able to speak on a person's  behalf, when they may not be able to do so for themselves.   People and their representatives had been consulted regarding end of life plans and wishes, where  appropriate, and these were recorded if they wished.  14 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us they were supported to make decisions about their daily life and were consulted on every  aspect of their support. One person said, ""I like going out for walks, or a drive up to my [relatives']. I also like  going out on my bike."" Another person said, ""I'm going on holiday soon. Blackpool.""  The staff we spoke with had a good awareness of the support needs and preferences of the people who  used the service. We found care plans were person-centred and explained how people liked to be  supported. Entries in the care plans we looked at included, ""What's important to me"", ""It is important that I  am given time to get ready on a morning as I like to take pride in my appearance and I like to smell nice.""  This helped care staff to know what was important to the people they cared for and helped them take  account of this information when delivering their care. We found staff were aware of this information and  people were supported according to their preferences.  We looked at four people's care plans. Care plans were very person-centred and contained detailed  information covering areas such as evening routine, mobility, living safely and taking risks, hygiene,  communication, medication, everyday tasks, decision-making, money, family and relationships, and sleep.  They included long term goals the person was working toward, such as 'Use the bus with staff support.' The  person whose care plan this was told us, ""I had a [health] check today. I came back on the bus. I went with  [name of staff]."" Care plans contained information in an accessible format with photographs of staff and the  person to support involvement.  Care plans also contained detailed information about people's individual behaviour management plans,  including details of how staff would care for people when they exhibited behaviours that challenged, and  the de-escalation techniques staff should use. When we spoke with members of staff they were aware of this  information. This showed the service responded to changes in the behaviour of people who used the service and put plans in place to reduce future risks.  The manager told us, and we saw from records, reviews were held regularly and care plans were reviewed  and updated regularly or when needs changed. These reviews helped monitor whether care records were up to date and reflected people's current needs so that any necessary actions could be identified at an early  stage. We discussed two minor recording issues regarding nutrition and the consistency of foods which  required clarification and the registered manager told us she would clarify this with the professionals  involved. The staff we spoke with knew about people's nutritional needs and the consistency of their food.  Daily records were also kept detailing what activities people had undertaken, what food had been eaten,  their mood and any incidents.   One person's relative said, ""My [relation] goes out most weeks. They take [them] out here, there and  everywhere. [They] could probably do with more activities and exercise though as [they're] putting weight  on. [They] definitely have more of a social life living at The Lodge and [they're] living with other service users, which has really helped [my relative]. [They go] out for lunch and [they] love to shop."" Another relative said,   15 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  ""My [relative] does woodwork, [they] go out for walks, and on their bike. They (the staff) take [my relative]  out for meals sometimes as well.""  We saw staff at The Lodge were responsive to people's needs, asking them questions about what they  wanted to do and planned future activities. Staff were patient with people, and listened to their responses.  This meant that the choices of people who used the service were respected.  Staff spoke with good insight into people's personal interests and we saw from people's support plans they  were given opportunities to pursue hobbies and activities of their choice. For example one staff member  told us they had a season ticket to support a person to go to football matches and they had helped them to  get their own bike from a local charity that recycles bikes for people to use. We heard how people were  being assisted to lead fulfilling lives and picked the things they wanted to take part in.  On the first day of our inspection one person was being supported to visit family members; another person  was going to an appointment and lunch, a third person was out at day centre, a fourth person was out  visiting friends without support, and a fifth person was listening to music in their room and then went for a  long walk in line with their recorded preferences.   Two people didn't go out of the home on the first day of our inspection. One person was using table top  items in the dining area with staff support and the other person spent time chatting with staff and resting in  their room. This person asked to go out and their care plan stated they enjoyed accessing the community.  Their activity time table for the day of our inspection said, ""Outing/lunch out/picnic."" We looked at the  person's activity records and found they had not been out of the home in the six days prior to our inspection.  We asked the registered manager about this and she told us the person was awaiting a social work  assessment for extra support hours, as their behaviour had deteriorated when out of the house and they  now needed two staff or one staff member very familiar and experienced with their needs, to accompany  them to maintain safety. This meant the person could not go out that day as the experienced staff member  had to stay in the building to support the other two staff members. The registered manager walked with the  person to the local garage to buy some sweets after our discussion and told us she would again follow up  the re-assessment. We looked at three other people's activity records and saw they were involved in regular activities inside and outside the home in line with their care plans.  Records showed each person had an individually planned holiday. One person's care plan detailed their  goal of going abroad on an aeroplane for the first time and we found this had now been achieved and they  had enjoyed their holiday.  One person said, ""[My relatives] visit me here."" Care plans contained a relationship circle for each person, so  staff knew which people were important to them. Staff told us and we saw from records how they enabled  people to see their families as often as they desired. This meant staff supported people with their social  needs.   The relatives we spoke with told us staff were always approachable and they were able to raise any  concerns. One relative said, ""The staff answer queries promptly."" People's views were sought by the  registered manager through meetings and one-to one conversations. We saw there was an easy read  complaints procedure in people's care files. Staff we spoke with said if a person wished to make a complaint they would facilitate this. The registered manager showed us there had been no formal complaints since our last inspection. They were clear about their responsibilities to respond to and investigate any concerns   16 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  received. Compliments had been received from family members and community professionals and fed back to staff at team meetings  17 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People told us the service was well-led. One person said, ""The manager is [name] and she's nice to me.""   A relative said, ""There is always a nice atmosphere when I've visited The Lodge. The manager is  approachable, in fact, all the staff are. We have no concerns at all."" A second relative said, ""No, I don't know  the manager sorry. My [relative] hasn't been there very long. The three or four staff I have met have all  seemed very nice though."" A third relative said, ""I've not spoken to the manager so I don't know who it is.  There has always been a nice atmosphere when I've visited and we are made to feel welcome by the staff.  They've had renovations recently and [my relative] likes things like that so [they're] happy.""  There was a registered manager in post who had been registered since June 2016. She had been asked by  the registered provider to manage two services since July 2017 and now spent two days at the other service  and three days a week at The Lodge. As a deputy manager was no longer in post at the second service the  registered manager had minimal management support with either service. The registered manager told us  she was finding it difficult to complete all the management tasks required for both services. The registered  provider had arranged for a temporary deputy manager to provide some management support at the  second service the week after our inspection for three days a week.  Each shift at The Lodge was led by a senior support worker, who completed some management tasks such  as medicines and financial audits.  Staff told us they felt supported by the registered manager and senior team, who always acted on their  concerns. One staff member said, ""[The registered manager] is a very good manager. Very approachable.""  Another staff member said, ""She is a good one. She looks after us."" Staff told us representatives of the  registered provider were also approachable.   At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to good governance because an effective system to improve the quality and safety of the service was not in  place, and the home was in a poor state of repair. At this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made, although we found a new breach of the regulation related to staff supervision. This meant  an improvement in governance was still required.  The registered provider had introduced a new system across all its services to ensure all management  information was kept in one place and was easily accessible. The new system included a walk through audit  of the building. We saw audits were maintained in relation to premises and equipment. There was evidence  of internal daily, weekly and monthly quality audits and actions identified who was responsible and by  which date. Care plans and documents were also reviewed and audited regularly. Daily audits were  completed on finances, and medicine stocks were checked three times a day. Building safety and cleaning  audits had been improved and we saw action was taken when issues arose.  The registered manager had an overview of audits and regularly recorded checks to ensure action had been   18 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  taken if required. There were gaps in some recent weekly and monthly medicines audits and checks on the  contents of first aid kits. The registered manager told us this was due to a reduction in management time  and said she would address this as soon as possible. Following our inspection the registered manager  showed us they had addressed the gaps with staff and ensured audits were completed. This meant they  were taking action to improve the service.  The registered provider had recently introduced policy knowledge checks with staff in areas such as  medicines, confidentiality, fire safety and safeguarding policy to ensure staff knowledge was up to date. This showed staff compliance with the registered provider's procedures was monitored.   Information was passed to the registered provider in a monthly report in areas including incidents and  accidents, safeguarding, training compliance and staff supervision. The locality manager visited the home  regularly to provide support and to complete audits and ensure compliance with the provider's policies and  procedures.   The registered manager had addressed issues as they arose, such as the recording of fridge temperatures  and cleaning up spillages, in ad hoc supervision with staff and at staff meetings. We saw from a medicines  audit in September 2017 gaps in recording had been followed up with staff. A monthly kitchen audit was  completed however on the second day of our inspection we found there were gaps in the recording of fridge  temperatures in the upper floor kitchen for the last five days. The registered manager said they would  address this with staff.  The registered manager told us she felt supported by the provider, and was able to contact a senior  manager at any time for support. The registered manager worked to an action plan completed in  conjunction with the locality manager and we saw action had been completed within the timescales set.  This demonstrated the senior management of the organisation were reviewing information to drive up  quality in the organisation, although this system had not effectively addressed the issue we found in relation to staff supervision.  The registered manager could demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the needs and preferences of the  people at The Lodge. She said her aim was for people to ""Live an independent and normal life and to do  what they want to do."" The registered manager told us she attended monthly managers' meetings, training  and events to keep up to date with good practice, and they were currently completing a level 5 qualification  in care management. This meant they were open to new ideas and keen to learn from others to achieve the  best possible outcomes for people using the service.  The service worked in partnership with community health professionals and commissioners and we saw  they worked together to meet people's needs and drive up the quality of the service. Two compliments had  been received from health professionals regarding the detailed care plans and health records kept by the  service, although we received feedback from another community professional following our inspection that  sufficient information was not available in records for them to complete an accurate assessment for one  person.  People who used the service and their representatives were asked for their views about the service and  these were acted upon. A house meeting had been held in June 2017 and topics discussed included  safeguarding, holidays, food choices, happiness with the service and having a barbeque. Photographs of  meals and holidays were used at meetings to support people's choices. Staff told us they struggled to get  some people to take part in group discussions and house meetings were infrequent.  19 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  People who used the service and their families were also consulted about the service on an individual basis.  Questionnaires were no longer sent out to family members every year by the registered provider and the  registered manager said it was now the individual home that sent these out and this had not yet been  completed, although feedback had been received verbally and by email from relatives in the form of  compliments. The registered manager said they would be sending out questionnaires to families in the near  future.  Staff meetings had been held on average every three months. Topics discussed included staff training,  completing kitchen checks, individual resident's needs, safeguarding, medicines policy, staffing and the  rota, and the last Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection. Staff meetings are an important part of the  provider's responsibility in monitoring the service and coming to an informed view as to the standard of care for people living at the home.  The registered manager understood her responsibilities with respect to the submission of statutory  notifications to the CQC. Notifications for all incidents which required submission to CQC had been made.  The previous inspection ratings were displayed at the home and a link to the ratings and last inspection  report was available on the registered provider's website. This showed the registered provider was meeting  their requirement to display the most recent performance assessment of their regulated activities and  showed they were open and transparent by sharing and displaying information about the service.  20 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

People in care homes receive accommodation and  personal care as single package under one contractual agreement. CQC regulates both the premises and the care provided and both were looked at during this inspection.   Summerfield Private Residential Home provides accommodation to a maximum of 32 people, spread over  two floors. The service caters for older people over 65 some of whom are living with dementia. The  accommodation is mostly single rooms with a small number of double rooms. It is located in Silsden, near  Keighley in West Yorkshire. At the time of the inspection 30 people were living in the home.   The inspection was undertaken on 12 February 2018 and was unannounced. At the last inspection in  September 2016 we rated the service 'Requires Improvement' overall. We identified a breach of Regulation 9  'Person centred care'. At this inspection we found improvements had been made and the location was no  longer in breach of this Regulation.   A registered manager was in place. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  People and relatives provided consistently positive feedback about the home. They said that care was of  high quality, personalised and met people's individual needs.  People praised the nice atmosphere within  the home and said staff were consistently kind and caring.    People felt safe living in the home. Systems were in place to protect people from abuse. Risks to people's  health and safety were regularly assessed and care plans put in place to help keep them safe. Staff had a  good understanding of the people living in the home and how to care for them safely. People received their  medicines consistently as prescribed.   There were enough staff working in the home to ensure people received prompt care and support. Staff had  time to chat with people as well as completing care tasks.

People received care from staff with the right skills and knowledge to care for them effectively.  Staff   2 Summerfield Private Residential Home 	" 19 March 2018  received a range of training and support from the management team.   People had access to a good range of food with sufficient choice and variability. People's nutritional needs  were assessed and where people were deemed at risk, plans of care were put in place to mitigate these risks.  The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and  staff supported them in the least restrictive way possible.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in September 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 12 February 2018 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two inspectors and two experts by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The experts by experience had  experience of older people's care.   During the inspection we spoke with eight people who used the service, one relative and two visitors. We  also spoke with the registered manager, deputy manager, a senior care worker, five care workers, the cook,  the activities co-ordinator and a domestic assistant. We observed care and support, including the mealtime  experience and looked around the home. We looked at five people's care records and other records such as  medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training records and maintenance  records. Following the inspection we telephoned two relatives to ask them for their views on the service.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health professional who works with the  service.   We used information the provider sent us in the Provider Information Return. This is information we require  providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the service   6 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  does well and improvements they plan to make.  7 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service safe?  Good  Our findings   People told us they felt safe living at Summerfield Residential Home. One person said ""Yes I am safe here, I  do feel safe at present."" Another person said ""If I didn't feel safe I wouldn't be here. A third person said ""Yes, I  feel safe more or less as much as you can feel safe. I don't get knocked about or anything like that here."" A  relative told us, ""Mum is safe here, I don't worry when I leave.""   Staff had completed safeguarding training and said they would not hesitate to report concerns to a senior  member of staff, the registered manager, the safeguarding team or CQC. We saw appropriate liaison and  referral to the local adult protection unit had been made following the identification of safeguarding  concerns. Measures were put in place following any safeguarding incidents to protect people, this included  safeguarding care plans where people were identified as being at risk. This helped keep people safe.   Risks to people's health and safety were assessed and mitigated against. This included the risks associated  with poor skin integrity, poor nutrition, moving and handling and behaviours that challenge. Risk  assessments were updated regularly and plans of care provided instructions on how to keep people safe.  Equipment such as air flow mattresses and bed rails were put in place following liaison with healthcare  professionals to help keep people safe. The service had recently made improvements to moving and  handling practices and had purchased new slings to ensure each person who required hoisting had their  own individualised sling. We observed people who had problems with their mobility being supported by  care staff. We saw one person being aided to move with assistance from a hoist into a wheelchair. Staff  explained to the person what they were doing whilst assisting them. We observed that the footplates on the  wheelchair were used. Our observations showed that staff assisted this person to move in a safe way.     Positive risks were undertaken to support people to maintain their freedom and achieve their goals. One  person had complex medical and mobility needs, but expressed a desire to go on a steam train. The service  had thought carefully about how this could be done safely and devised a positive risk assessment to allow  the person to go. Staff had reviewed the trip afterwards and recorded a positive outcome for the person.  Staff had concluded ""Just because there are risks and obstacles doesn't meant that trips out for people with medical and mobility concerns are impossible.""  This showed a good approach to ensuring risks did not  restrict people's freedom and ability to achieve their goals.   The premises was safely managed and suitable for its intended purpose. Checks were undertaken on the  gas, electrical and fire systems as well as equipment such as hoists to ensure they remained safe.   Temperature checks were undertaken on hot water systems to ensure they remained within safe limits,  although some outlets had not been tested for several months.  We checked some taps and found the water  temperatures to be safe.   Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEP) were in place for each person showing how to evacuate them  in a fire. These were stored electronically and also in a folder so they could be accessed quickly in the event  of an emergency. A fire risk assessment had been carried out by a competent person and the registered  manager had made fire safety improvements as per their recommendations.  8 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded there were sufficient quantities to staff to ensure prompt and safe care. Overall, people told  us they thought there were sufficient numbers of staff at the home. One person said, ""Oh yes, I feel very safe  in this place, because there is always staff about."" Another person said, ""I feel safe at night as there are three  staff on at night. If I press that button on that wall, they would come immediately."" A third person said,  ""There are enough carers here."" Staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on each shift to ensure  people's needs were met. The registered manager told us staffing levels could be increased if people's needs changed and this was confirmed by staff.   Rotas' showed the required staffing levels were consistently maintained. The registered manager or deputy  were on call should they be needed out of hours in an emergency. The registered manager did not use  agency staff. When there were shifts to be covered existing staff picked these up so people were provided  with consistent care from familiar staff. The care team were supported by housekeepers, cooks, laundry staff and an activities co-ordinator. We saw there was a good staff presence around the home and heard call bells were answered in a timely way. We concluded there were enough staff to care for people safely and to keep  the home clean.  We reviewed three staff files and found safe recruitment procedures were in place to ensure new staff were  of suitable character to work with vulnerable people. New staff were required to complete an application  form and attend an interview. Disclosure and Baring Service (DBS) checks and references were then taken  up.  Any issues raised had been thoroughly risk assessed by the registered manager to ensure staff were safe  to work at the service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us they got  their medicines consistently and on time. One person said, ""I am a diabetic. They [staff] have to do my  bloods every day. They [staff] manage my diabetes better than the nurses did when I was in hospital. Senior  staff give me my medication, which I always get on time."" Medication care plans were in place which gave  information, for example of any allergies and how people preferred to take their medicines. This  demonstrated each person had a personalised plan to support them to take their medicines safely.   We saw medicines were stored in locked trolleys, cabinets or fridges, all of which were clean and tidy. Senior  staff took responsibility for administering medicines and we saw them doing this with patience and  kindness. We spoke with a senior care worker who confirmed they had received training and the deputy  manager told us they observed staff administering medicines as part of their medicines audit. We looked at  a sample of medication administration records (MARs) and saw people were being given medicines as  prescribed. We checked a random sample of medicines and found the stocks being held were accurate. This  showed us medicines were being managed safely.  The home was also clean and free from odours in all of the communal areas. People living at the service  confirmed that the home was always kept clean and odour free. One person told us, ""The home is clean –  the bathroom, everywhere is kept spotless. It is always nice and warm here.""Another person said, ""The  cleaner here is one of the best I have ever seen."" A third person said, ""This is a nice, warm house – very clean  – we have cleaners in every day.""  Cleaning staff were in place and they said they had the resources and time  to keep the home clean. We saw staff adhering to good infection control techniques and checks were  regularly undertaken on infection control and cleaning practices.  We saw systems were in place to ensure  items were laundered promptly although due to space limitations in the laundry room, there was not a clear separation of clean and dirty laundry.   Incidents and accidents were recorded and action taken to reduce the likelihood of a re-occurrence.  Following each incident a management report was completed detailing the suspected cause and any action  9 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  needed.  Incidents were analysed each month to look for any themes and trends and to check that  appropriate action had been taken to prevent a re-occurrence. We saw following incidents such as falls,  liaison took place with district nurses and risk assessments were updated to help reduce the risk of repeat  incidents.  10 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service effective?  Good  Our findings   Care records demonstrated people's needs were assessed and people told us care was delivered in line with their wishes. The service subscribed to a number of publications to keep up-to-date with best practice  guidance.  The registered manager attended provider forums run by the local authority, which also helped  them keep up-to-date with best practice. They demonstrated to us they improved practice based on  research and guidance.  For example the registered manager had read a study with showed that people  living with dementia benefit from at least an hour of individualised interaction and activity per week. This  had led to them reiterating the importance of personated interaction with the staff team, arranging for staff  to spend more time with each resident.  They told us they had already seen positive outcomes in terms of  people's mood and behaviour and hoped to formally record their findings over the coming months.   We concluded staff had the right skills, knowledge and experience to care for people.  One relative said of  staff ,""Very good staff, all switched on."" Staff were knowledgeable about people and how to meet their  needs. Staff received a range of training relevant to their role. The training matrix showed staff were up to  date with training, or refresher training had been booked. Training courses included infection control,  medicines, first aid, food hygiene, continence care, care planning, moving and handling, palliative care and  safeguarding. We saw staff had also received specialist training in topics such as how to use food  supplements, diabetes and dementia care.  The registered manager told us new staff completed induction training and were enrolled on the Care  Certificate. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip social care and health workers with  the knowledge and skills they need to provide safe, compassionate care. We saw evidence of induction in  the staff files we reviewed. We spoke with one member of care staff who had been recruited recently. They  told us their induction had been comprehensive and had included a period of shadowing which they said  had helped them get to know people who used the service.   Staff were provided with supervision sessions which gave them the opportunity to discuss their work role,  any issues and their professional development. Staff also had an annual appraisal. Staff we spoke with told  us they felt supported and said they could go to the registered manager or deputy manager at any time for  advice or support.  People were supported to maintain a good balanced diet.  People spoke positively about the choice and  quality of food available.  Comments included, ""I have no complaints about the food. You can have what you want. I think you can have a cooked breakfast – not that I have one – but the gentleman opposite me has  bacon."" ""It's not so bad. I usually have porridge and toast. I could have a cooked breakfast if I wanted one.  Some people have bacon and eggs."" ""The food is good here. We all like good food."" ""The food is very good.  We have a choice – they will give you whatever you want for breakfast. If you wanted a cooked breakfast you  can have one. I have my meals in the dining room but you can have your meals in your room.""  Menu's showed sufficient choice and variation of food. There was a four week cycle of menus in operation  and the registered manager explained adjustments to these could be made to incorporate people's   11 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  preferences. The cook also catered for any special diet's such as diabetic and soft meals. Care staff made the cook aware if people were losing weight and meals and drinks were fortified accordingly. Jugs of nutritional  supplements and fortified milk were made up in the mornings so they were available when needed.   During  the morning we saw people being asked if they wanted drinks as we saw a drinks trolley being taken around  the home. We also observed jugs of both blackcurrant and orange juices, in the lounges as well as snacks.  Mid-morning drinks and snacks were on offer and mid-afternoon drinks and cake were served to provide  people with additional nutrition.   We observed lunchtime in the dining room and found it to be a positive experience. All the tables had been  set with cutlery and condiments. There were flowers and serviettes on each table.  We observed one person  who needed some support with their meal. Staff were supportive yet unobtrusive. People were also offered  clothes protectors before commencing to eat their meal.  We saw that people were given choices as to  where they wished to eat their lunch.  Some people had their lunch in their own rooms.   We looked at the care records for one person who had been assessed as being nutritionally at risk and saw  their weight was being monitored closely. We saw staff, patiently sitting with them, offering them  encouragement to eat and drink.  People had nutritional risk assessments and care plans in place which  were regularly updated. This provided us with assurance people's nutritional needs were being met.   The service worked with other organisations and health professionals to help ensure effective care and  treatment. People we spoke with confirmed they had access to health care services and reported no  concerns in this area.  One person said ""The district nurse come in regularly she is coming in today to see to  my leg."" Another person said, ""If I became unwell –they [staff] would get the doctor out."" A third person said,  ""If I became unwell they [staff] would get the doctor out straight away. If someone was admitted to hospital,  a summary care plan was sent with them so the hospital had information on their care and support needs.   We saw feedback had been received from the hospital praising the quality of the care plans which  accompanied people as well as the knowledge of the care home staff that had supported them.  This helped ensure people received good joined up care when moving between services.   The 'Tele medicines system' was in use at the service. This was a free system for care homes provided by the  NHS and run exclusively from Airedale Hospital. The NHS provided the home with a laptop and camera to  run the system, when this was set up the care home could get straight through to the Nurses Hub at Airedale Hospital for advice. This was a fully portable system and could be taken to peoples bedrooms where they  could speak directly to a nurse.  If there were visible symptoms the camera could focus on these and it  would show up on the screen for the medics to assess and give advice. It could also be used to get advice on medicines. If someone required hospital treatment 'Tele medicines' staff could fast track the admission.    Care records assessed people's health conditions and put plans of care in place for staff to follow.  In the  care records we looked at we saw people had been seen by a range of health care professionals, including  GPs, opticians, dentists and podiatrists.  Staff told us if there were any concerns about people's health the  senior members of staff acted promptly either by using the 'Telemedicines' system or by contacting a GP. A  senior care worker said if anyone was a bit out of character they would routinely get a urine sample to rule  out any underlying infection. We concluded people's health care needs were being met.  The premises were of high quality, appropriately designed and adapted to meet people's individual needs.   People's bedrooms were a reasonable size and overlooked the garden of the property. We saw that people  had their own television/radio as some told us they chose to spend a lot of time in their own room. They told us they did this because they preferred the quietness of their own bedroom. Some people had photographs  of members of their family around them on their bedside tables. One person had brought their own cat into   12 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  the home. They told us how much comfort this brought them. The person said, ""They [staff] even let me  bring my cat into the home, which was brilliant.""  We saw that communal areas were nicely furnished and decorated. The furnishings were of a good  standard. Communal areas were well lit. We saw that there were no light bulbs either missing or not  working, which meant that staff worked hard to maintain good lighting to promote a homely atmosphere  and help reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that bedrooms were always re- decorated before people moved into them to ensure a high quality living environment. We saw there was a  person centred approach to this. For example two male residents had agreed to move into a room together,  a large room had been chosen to safely accommodate the moving and handling equipment they required.  The room was being decorated and furnished to their preferences with a large flat-screen television being  placed on the wall.  This demonstrated a person centred approach.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The service was acting within the  Mental Capacity Act. People's capacity to consent to their care and support arrangements was assessed.  Where people lacked capacity and it had been assessed that the accumulation of restrictions amounted to a deprivation of liberty, appropriate DoLS applications had been made. There was one current authorised  DoLS in place with other applications awaiting assessment by the local authority. The authorised DoLS had  one condition attached to it which had been met by the service.    People were asked consent before care and support was provided. Where people lacked capacity best  interest decisions had been made involving families and staff from the service. We saw clear best interest  processes had been followed, for example, for people who were moving bedrooms.  The registered manager had a list of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) which were in place. A LPA is a legal  document that allows someone to make decisions for you, or act on your behalf, if you're no longer able to  or if you no longer want to make your own decisions. LPA's can be put in place for property and financial  affairs or health and welfare. This showed us the registered manager understood their responsibilities to act  within the legislation.  13 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service caring?  Good  Our findings   At the last two inspections we found a lack of person centred approach regarding some people's mealtime  regimes. We found there was not always an appropriate gap between breakfast and lunchtime, which  demonstrated a lack of person centred approach to care and support. At this inspection we found  improvements had been made. More thought had gone into planning mealtimes to meet people's individual needs.  People could eat at a time that suited them, and we saw appropriate gaps between meals for those  who needed assistance.   Everyone told us they were well looked after by staff. Comments included: ""They [staff] are all very good and  nice. The staff do treat me well, but I do think they work hard."" They [staff] are not so bad – they are easy to  get on with."" ""They [staff] are human – very friendly.""  ""The staff are very good here. I am very pleased with  the staff – they do their very best and are very helpful."" The staff are wonderful. They [staff] are brilliant and  all of them are very obliging."" A relative told us, ""It's fantastic here and Mum is so happy.""  We spoke with two visitors, who had turned up unannounced to see if the service would be suitable for their relative. They told  us they had been shown around everywhere and thought it was a warm, welcoming, friendly home with  plenty going on.    We observed care. People looked relaxed and comfortable around staff. There was a calm, friendly  atmosphere and we saw staff took time to sit and chat with people. We heard some good humoured banter  shared between people who used the service and staff which resulted in much laughter.  Staff took the time  to talk to people in between care and support tasks. This provided good companionship to people and  made for a lovely atmosphere.   Staff knew people well, for example, we asked them about one person whose care plan we had looked at.  They told us the person liked Opera music and fashion and always liked to be colour co-ordinated. We saw  this person looked well dressed and the entry in the daily records read, ""[Name] looks very smart this  morning with a pale yellow cardigan on, she chose her own clothes."" Person centred information on  people's likes, dislikes and history was maintained in care records which demonstrated staff had sought to  know about people to help provide individualised care and support.   Care staff were very considerate towards people, for example, at breakfast time one person complained  their coffee was 'horrible.' A care worker made them another drink and checked that one was alright before  continuing with their other duties. Another member of staff was sitting with three people in one of the  lounges and discussing with them what they might like to watch on TV. The final decision was a wildlife  programme.  People were able to express their views and were involved in making decisions about their care and support. During the inspection we saw staff asking people where they wanted to sit, what they wanted to eat and do.  Staff patiently waited for people to respond before taking action to meet their requests. Staff meeting  minutes showed that staff were constantly reminded of the importance of offering people choices, even if  they knew people's preferences well.  People had chosen décor, food and activities in the home.  This   14 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  demonstrated the service recognised the importance of listening and acting on people's views. People  confirmed they were able to make choices. For example they said they were able to get up and go to bed at  the times they wanted. One person said ""Yes, you can please yourself as to when you go to bed. I was very  tired yesterday- so I went to bed at 5:45pm – I know it was early but I was exhausted after so many visitors.""  Care plans showed that people and relatives had been consulted over care and support needs. Relatives  told us they felt involved in care and support decisions. We saw they were regularly contacted should  people's care needs changed. Relatives described communication as good.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the registered manager, staff,  people and visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service.  People were consistently treated with dignity and respect by staff.  We saw staff lower their voices to discuss  care and support tasks with people to maintain their confidentiality. Staff knocked on bedroom doors  before entering and ensured doors were closed during the provision of personal care.  If people's relatives  couldn't assist, the service supported people to attend hospital and other medical appointments.  This  helped reduce distress to people. This service was provided free of charge which demonstrated a caring  service.   We asked people about visiting times at the home. People told us their relatives and friends could visit at  any time and that they were unaware of any restrictions. One person said, ""Yes. I do get visitors. They can  visit at any time. There are no restrictions."" Another person said, ""Yes, my neighbours visit every week. There  are no restrictions as to when they visit.""  15 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service responsive?  Good  Our findings   People told us there was a personalised approach to care and support. For example people said they could  follow their preferred daily regimes. They said care was appropriate and met their individual needs.  A  relative said there had been an ""amazing transformation"" in their relatives' condition since they moved to  the home and their care needs were consistently met.  Another relative said, ""They do look after people  really really well"".   Electronic care records were maintained which showed people's needs had been assessed in a range of  areas including nutrition, mobility, social activities and personal care. Regular entries of the care provided  were inputted by care staff. We looked at these which demonstrated people had received the required care  and support interventions. Care and support plans were regularly updated and reviewed when people's  needs changed. This helped ensure responsive care.   The registered manager and deputy manager had attended an information session held by Bradford Council relating to the Accessible Information Standards. They understood their responsibilities in relation to this.  People's care plans gave clear information to staff about people's individual communication needs. For  example one person was partially sighted and there were clear instructions recorded on how to meet their  needs.  We saw staff adapting the way they communicated with people dependant on their individual  communication abilities.   People had access to a wide range of activities which were positively received by people. Comments  included: ""We have a bit of dancing, exercise with a ball."" ""You can go out for a walk if you want to."" ""We  have an entertainments girls who is always organising things. Mondays – we have music – we have a lady  who comes and plays the harp. Next month we have some Alpacas vising the home. We are going out to  Embsay railway. We have been to Scarborough, Bolton Abbey and the Carlisle railway. I like spending a lot of time in my own room – as I like to watch television. I also like sitting outside – when it's good weather."" On  the day of the inspection, people were celebrating one person's birthday in the main lounge near to the  office, during our visit. People were enjoying music, singing, drinks and birthday cake.  An activities co-ordinator was employed who worked four days a week. The programme of activities was on  display in the dining room, which included arts and crafts, light exercises, film afternoon and trips out. There  were also outside entertainers who came into the home. For example, every Monday evening there was a  sing- a-long with The Music Man, Golden Oldies on the first Thursday of every month and Healing Music. On  Friday mornings people could go out to visit Silsden Methodist Church. The activities co-ordinator also  arranged trips out using a local wheelchair accessible Taxi service. These trips included Garden Centres and  Bolton Abbey.   The service undertook one to one activities with some people so they did not become  socially isolated. We saw examples where staff had played music through a tablet computer to people  individually resulting in positive outcomes.  Links to a local Primary School had been developed with the children coming into the home at Christmas to  sing. Arrangements had since been made for four or five children to visit the home every other Thursday to   16 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  read to the people who lived there. There were photographs on display of various events and people's art  work was on display. We concluded people were being provided with a range of activities and social  opportunities to keep them occupied and meet their individual and diverse needs.   People we spoke with knew who to speak to if they had a complaint or any concerns. They all said they  would go the manager. People said they were satisfied with the service and had no complaints. The  complaints procedure was on display and care plans contained information about the support people may  need in order to make a complaint. One relative told us they would feel able to raise any concerns with the  registered manager or deputy manager. We looked at the complaints log and saw any complaints which had been made had been fully investigated and an outcome had been reached in each case. This showed us  concerns were taken seriously and dealt with appropriately. A significant number of compliments had been  received about the service and these were recorded so the service knew the areas in which it exceeded  expectations. For example one said, 'Thank you all so much for looking after my mum and for all your  kindness.' Another said, 'We would like to say all your staff are wonderful , caring and respectful, we cannot  thank you enough.'  Care planning demonstrated the service spoke to people and their relatives to help establish their end of life  needs and wishes.  We saw examples where this had resulted in care plans being produced to guide staff on  the care required.   17 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service well-led?  Good  Our findings   People and relatives told us they were highly satisfied with the service. No-one we spoke with raised any  concerns with us during our visit. One person said, ""Overall, I am happy with everything. The staff treat me  well.""  Another person said, ""It's very good here actually. Overall, I would definitely recommend this home to  people."" A third person said, ""Overall, I would recommend the home to other people. I am very pleased to be here. We have residents meetings once a month – they ask if we are happy with everything. I am very  satisfied with everything."" Another person said, ""I would recommend anyone to live here – as it is very nice.""  A relative said, ""Really really good, great place, the thing for me is the consistency of care.""  All of the staff we spoke with told us they would recommend Summerfield Private Residential Home as a  place to be cared for and to work. Comments included; ""It's a nice staff team, carers are good and interact  well with residents. I very much enjoy coming to work."" ""It's a nice, friendly home to work in. The manager is  out on the floor and is approachable. I enjoy coming to work and wouldn't work anywhere else."" Staff told  us the manager and provider were very responsive if anything was needed, for example, replacement of  carpets or new equipment.  People and staff both said the manager and provider were friendly, approachable and helped deal with any  issues or problems that arose. We observed a friendly, visibly person centred culture within the home with  staff working well together to help ensure people's care experience was as positive as possible.   Systems were in place to assess, monitor and improve the service. Audits took place in a range of areas  including infection control, the homes environment and medicines. An overall care audit reviewed people's  care and support needs including care plan documentation. The manager also conducted regular night  checks to provide assurance the home was operating safely at night. A staff member reviewed daily care  reports made by staff on the computerised system each day to determine whether they were appropriate  and ensure the required care and support could be evidenced.  Staff confirmed meetings were held and they felt able to have an open discussion with the management team.  The minutes of these meetings showed  the service was committed to continuous improvement, with quality and care issues discussed to help  improve performance.  We spoke with the registered manager and deputy manager who both demonstrated they were committed  to continuous improvement of the service.  They attended conferences, training and read care relating  publications to keep up-to-date with best practice guidance.  We saw they had produced 'case studies' to  demonstrate where the service had helped people to achieve a positive care or support outcome. This  included learning points to further improve the service.  For example one case study demonstrated how the  service had successfully supported a person to make contact with old friends and their place of worship. The details of this were recorded to aid further learning and improvement.  Another case study demonstrated  lessons learnt as a result of a delay in a person receiving their medicines. Incidents and accidents were  analysed for possible causes to aid improvements to the safety of the service.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including the local hospital to ensure joined up care for   18 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  people.  For example staff helped people attend appointments and there was a dedicated care plan given to hospital and other professionals so these agencies had concise information on people's needs.    People's views and feedback were sought and used to make improvements to the service. Monthly resident  meetings were held which had a good attendance. We looked at the minutes of the February 2018 meeting  which showed people felt happy safe and comfortable. People discussed a range of topics including  activities and meals. We saw people's feedback had been acted on. For example people were asked if they  would like local nursery school children to visit and they had said yes. This was currently being arranged  demonstrating people's views were being acted on.     The last resident and relative's survey had been completed in July 2017 and we saw the results were  extremely positive which was in line with our observations and feedback people gave us during the  inspection. Comments included; ""Excellent place, great staff and management."" Staff show outstanding  empathy with residents."" ""Staff always cheerful, smiling and polite."" ""Has been in three previous homes and  I am happiest with this one and so is he.""; ""Residents always come first."" ""Residents are happy here."" ""The  home is well kept."" ""If I had parents still alive this is the home I would bring them to if they ever needed one.  It's like home from home."" ""The residents get what they want."" ""Nothing is too much trouble.""  19 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  "	 19 March 2018  received a range of training and support from the management team.   People had access to a good range of food with sufficient choice and variability. People's nutritional needs  were assessed and where people were deemed at risk, plans of care were put in place to mitigate these risks.  The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and  staff supported them in the least restrictive way possible. People's consent was sought before care and  support was offered.   The service worked well with a range of health professionals to help ensure people's needs were met. Care  needs were assessed and appropriate plans of care put in place. People told us care needs were met by the  service.   Staff were kind and caring and treated people with a high level of dignity and respect. Staff had developed  good relationships with people and knew them well. Care was person centred, focused on meeting people's  individual preferences and taking their views into account.  People had access to a wide range of activities  and social opportunities.   People were very satisfied with the service, but should they wish to complain, systems were in place to  ensure they were able to. Any complaints were logged, investigated and responded to in a timely manner.   There was a good person centred culture within the home and friendly atmosphere.  People, relatives and  staff all spoke positively about the way the service was run.    Systems were in place to monitor and check how the service was operating. Where issues were found, action was taken to ensure a high performing service. People were regularly asked for their feedback in a number of areas and this was used to further improve the service.  3 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in September 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 12 February 2018 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two inspectors and two experts by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The experts by experience had  experience of older people's care.   During the inspection we spoke with eight people who used the service, one relative and two visitors. We  also spoke with the registered manager, deputy manager, a senior care worker, five care workers, the cook,  the activities co-ordinator and a domestic assistant. We observed care and support, including the mealtime  experience and looked around the home. We looked at five people's care records and other records such as  medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training records and maintenance  records. Following the inspection we telephoned two relatives to ask them for their views on the service.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health professional who works with the  service.   We used information the provider sent us in the Provider Information Return. This is information we require  providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the service   6 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  does well and improvements they plan to make.  7 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   	  Good  	"   People told us they felt safe living at Summerfield Residential Home. One person said ""Yes I am safe here, I  do feel safe at present."" Another person said ""If I didn't feel safe I wouldn't be here. A third person said ""Yes, I  feel safe more or less as much as you can feel safe. I don't get knocked about or anything like that here."" A  relative told us, ""Mum is safe here, I don't worry when I leave.""   Staff had completed safeguarding training and said they would not hesitate to report concerns to a senior  member of staff, the registered manager, the safeguarding team or CQC. We saw appropriate liaison and  referral to the local adult protection unit had been made following the identification of safeguarding  concerns. Measures were put in place following any safeguarding incidents to protect people, this included  safeguarding care plans where people were identified as being at risk. This helped keep people safe.   Risks to people's health and safety were assessed and mitigated against. This included the risks associated  with poor skin integrity, poor nutrition, moving and handling and behaviours that challenge. Risk  assessments were updated regularly and plans of care provided instructions on how to keep people safe.  Equipment such as air flow mattresses and bed rails were put in place following liaison with healthcare  professionals to help keep people safe. The service had recently made improvements to moving and  handling practices and had purchased new slings to ensure each person who required hoisting had their  own individualised sling. We observed people who had problems with their mobility being supported by  care staff. We saw one person being aided to move with assistance from a hoist into a wheelchair. Staff  explained to the person what they were doing whilst assisting them. We observed that the footplates on the  wheelchair were used. Our observations showed that staff assisted this person to move in a safe way.     Positive risks were undertaken to support people to maintain their freedom and achieve their goals. One  person had complex medical and mobility needs, but expressed a desire to go on a steam train. The service  had thought carefully about how this could be done safely and devised a positive risk assessment to allow  the person to go. Staff had reviewed the trip afterwards and recorded a positive outcome for the person.  Staff had concluded ""Just because there are risks and obstacles doesn't meant that trips out for people with medical and mobility concerns are impossible.""  This showed a good approach to ensuring risks did not  restrict people's freedom and ability to achieve their goals.   The premises was safely managed and suitable for its intended purpose. Checks were undertaken on the  gas, electrical and fire systems as well as equipment such as hoists to ensure they remained safe.   Temperature checks were undertaken on hot water systems to ensure they remained within safe limits,  although some outlets had not been tested for several months.  We checked some taps and found the water  temperatures to be safe.   Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEP) were in place for each person showing how to evacuate them  in a fire. These were stored electronically and also in a folder so they could be accessed quickly in the event  of an emergency. A fire risk assessment had been carried out by a competent person and the registered  manager had made fire safety improvements as per their recommendations.  8 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded there were sufficient quantities to staff to ensure prompt and safe care. Overall, people told  us they thought there were sufficient numbers of staff at the home. One person said, ""Oh yes, I feel very safe  in this place, because there is always staff about."" Another person said, ""I feel safe at night as there are three  staff on at night. If I press that button on that wall, they would come immediately."" A third person said,  ""There are enough carers here."" Staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on each shift to ensure  people's needs were met. The registered manager told us staffing levels could be increased if people's needs changed and this was confirmed by staff.   Rotas' showed the required staffing levels were consistently maintained. The registered manager or deputy  were on call should they be needed out of hours in an emergency. The registered manager did not use  agency staff. When there were shifts to be covered existing staff picked these up so people were provided  with consistent care from familiar staff. The care team were supported by housekeepers, cooks, laundry staff and an activities co-ordinator. We saw there was a good staff presence around the home and heard call bells were answered in a timely way. We concluded there were enough staff to care for people safely and to keep  the home clean.  We reviewed three staff files and found safe recruitment procedures were in place to ensure new staff were  of suitable character to work with vulnerable people. New staff were required to complete an application  form and attend an interview. Disclosure and Baring Service (DBS) checks and references were then taken  up.  Any issues raised had been thoroughly risk assessed by the registered manager to ensure staff were safe  to work at the service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us they got  their medicines consistently and on time. One person said, ""I am a diabetic. They [staff] have to do my  bloods every day. They [staff] manage my diabetes better than the nurses did when I was in hospital. Senior  staff give me my medication, which I always get on time."" Medication care plans were in place which gave  information, for example of any allergies and how people preferred to take their medicines. This  demonstrated each person had a personalised plan to support them to take their medicines safely.   We saw medicines were stored in locked trolleys, cabinets or fridges, all of which were clean and tidy. Senior  staff took responsibility for administering medicines and we saw them doing this with patience and  kindness. We spoke with a senior care worker who confirmed they had received training and the deputy  manager told us they observed staff administering medicines as part of their medicines audit. We looked at  a sample of medication administration records (MARs) and saw people were being given medicines as  prescribed. We checked a random sample of medicines and found the stocks being held were accurate. This  showed us medicines were being managed safely.  The home was also clean and free from odours in all of the communal areas. People living at the service  confirmed that the home was always kept clean and odour free. One person told us, ""The home is clean –  the bathroom, everywhere is kept spotless. It is always nice and warm here.""Another person said, ""The  cleaner here is one of the best I have ever seen."" A third person said, ""This is a nice, warm house – very clean  – we have cleaners in every day.""  Cleaning staff were in place and they said they had the resources and time  to keep the home clean. We saw staff adhering to good infection control techniques and checks were  regularly undertaken on infection control and cleaning practices.  We saw systems were in place to ensure  items were laundered promptly although due to space limitations in the laundry room, there was not a clear separation of clean and dirty laundry.   Incidents and accidents were recorded and action taken to reduce the likelihood of a re-occurrence.  Following each incident a management report was completed detailing the suspected cause and any action  9 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  needed.  Incidents were analysed each month to look for any themes and trends and to check that  appropriate action had been taken to prevent a re-occurrence. We saw following incidents such as falls,  liaison took place with district nurses and risk assessments were updated to help reduce the risk of repeat  incidents.  10 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   Care records demonstrated people's needs were assessed and people told us care was delivered in line with their wishes. The service subscribed to a number of publications to keep up-to-date with best practice  guidance.  The registered manager attended provider forums run by the local authority, which also helped  them keep up-to-date with best practice. They demonstrated to us they improved practice based on  research and guidance.  For example the registered manager had read a study with showed that people  living with dementia benefit from at least an hour of individualised interaction and activity per week. This  had led to them reiterating the importance of personated interaction with the staff team, arranging for staff  to spend more time with each resident.  They told us they had already seen positive outcomes in terms of  people's mood and behaviour and hoped to formally record their findings over the coming months.   We concluded staff had the right skills, knowledge and experience to care for people.  One relative said of  staff ,""Very good staff, all switched on."" Staff were knowledgeable about people and how to meet their  needs. Staff received a range of training relevant to their role. The training matrix showed staff were up to  date with training, or refresher training had been booked. Training courses included infection control,  medicines, first aid, food hygiene, continence care, care planning, moving and handling, palliative care and  safeguarding. We saw staff had also received specialist training in topics such as how to use food  supplements, diabetes and dementia care.  The registered manager told us new staff completed induction training and were enrolled on the Care  Certificate. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip social care and health workers with  the knowledge and skills they need to provide safe, compassionate care. We saw evidence of induction in  the staff files we reviewed. We spoke with one member of care staff who had been recruited recently. They  told us their induction had been comprehensive and had included a period of shadowing which they said  had helped them get to know people who used the service.   Staff were provided with supervision sessions which gave them the opportunity to discuss their work role,  any issues and their professional development. Staff also had an annual appraisal. Staff we spoke with told  us they felt supported and said they could go to the registered manager or deputy manager at any time for  advice or support.  People were supported to maintain a good balanced diet.  People spoke positively about the choice and  quality of food available.  Comments included, ""I have no complaints about the food. You can have what you want. I think you can have a cooked breakfast – not that I have one – but the gentleman opposite me has  bacon."" ""It's not so bad. I usually have porridge and toast. I could have a cooked breakfast if I wanted one.  Some people have bacon and eggs."" ""The food is good here. We all like good food."" ""The food is very good.  We have a choice – they will give you whatever you want for breakfast. If you wanted a cooked breakfast you  can have one. I have my meals in the dining room but you can have your meals in your room.""  Menu's showed sufficient choice and variation of food. There was a four week cycle of menus in operation  and the registered manager explained adjustments to these could be made to incorporate people's   11 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  preferences. The cook also catered for any special diet's such as diabetic and soft meals. Care staff made the cook aware if people were losing weight and meals and drinks were fortified accordingly. Jugs of nutritional  supplements and fortified milk were made up in the mornings so they were available when needed.   During  the morning we saw people being asked if they wanted drinks as we saw a drinks trolley being taken around  the home. We also observed jugs of both blackcurrant and orange juices, in the lounges as well as snacks.  Mid-morning drinks and snacks were on offer and mid-afternoon drinks and cake were served to provide  people with additional nutrition.   We observed lunchtime in the dining room and found it to be a positive experience. All the tables had been  set with cutlery and condiments. There were flowers and serviettes on each table.  We observed one person  who needed some support with their meal. Staff were supportive yet unobtrusive. People were also offered  clothes protectors before commencing to eat their meal.  We saw that people were given choices as to  where they wished to eat their lunch.  Some people had their lunch in their own rooms.   We looked at the care records for one person who had been assessed as being nutritionally at risk and saw  their weight was being monitored closely. We saw staff, patiently sitting with them, offering them  encouragement to eat and drink.  People had nutritional risk assessments and care plans in place which  were regularly updated. This provided us with assurance people's nutritional needs were being met.   The service worked with other organisations and health professionals to help ensure effective care and  treatment. People we spoke with confirmed they had access to health care services and reported no  concerns in this area.  One person said ""The district nurse come in regularly she is coming in today to see to  my leg."" Another person said, ""If I became unwell –they [staff] would get the doctor out."" A third person said,  ""If I became unwell they [staff] would get the doctor out straight away. If someone was admitted to hospital,  a summary care plan was sent with them so the hospital had information on their care and support needs.   We saw feedback had been received from the hospital praising the quality of the care plans which  accompanied people as well as the knowledge of the care home staff that had supported them.  This helped ensure people received good joined up care when moving between services.   The 'Tele medicines system' was in use at the service. This was a free system for care homes provided by the  NHS and run exclusively from Airedale Hospital. The NHS provided the home with a laptop and camera to  run the system, when this was set up the care home could get straight through to the Nurses Hub at Airedale Hospital for advice. This was a fully portable system and could be taken to peoples bedrooms where they  could speak directly to a nurse.  If there were visible symptoms the camera could focus on these and it  would show up on the screen for the medics to assess and give advice. It could also be used to get advice on medicines. If someone required hospital treatment 'Tele medicines' staff could fast track the admission.    Care records assessed people's health conditions and put plans of care in place for staff to follow.  In the  care records we looked at we saw people had been seen by a range of health care professionals, including  GPs, opticians, dentists and podiatrists.  Staff told us if there were any concerns about people's health the  senior members of staff acted promptly either by using the 'Telemedicines' system or by contacting a GP. A  senior care worker said if anyone was a bit out of character they would routinely get a urine sample to rule  out any underlying infection. We concluded people's health care needs were being met.  The premises were of high quality, appropriately designed and adapted to meet people's individual needs.   People's bedrooms were a reasonable size and overlooked the garden of the property. We saw that people  had their own television/radio as some told us they chose to spend a lot of time in their own room. They told us they did this because they preferred the quietness of their own bedroom. Some people had photographs  of members of their family around them on their bedside tables. One person had brought their own cat into   12 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  the home. They told us how much comfort this brought them. The person said, ""They [staff] even let me  bring my cat into the home, which was brilliant.""  We saw that communal areas were nicely furnished and decorated. The furnishings were of a good  standard. Communal areas were well lit. We saw that there were no light bulbs either missing or not  working, which meant that staff worked hard to maintain good lighting to promote a homely atmosphere  and help reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that bedrooms were always re- decorated before people moved into them to ensure a high quality living environment. We saw there was a  person centred approach to this. For example two male residents had agreed to move into a room together,  a large room had been chosen to safely accommodate the moving and handling equipment they required.  The room was being decorated and furnished to their preferences with a large flat-screen television being  placed on the wall.  This demonstrated a person centred approach.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The service was acting within the  Mental Capacity Act. People's capacity to consent to their care and support arrangements was assessed.  Where people lacked capacity and it had been assessed that the accumulation of restrictions amounted to a deprivation of liberty, appropriate DoLS applications had been made. There was one current authorised  DoLS in place with other applications awaiting assessment by the local authority. The authorised DoLS had  one condition attached to it which had been met by the service.    People were asked consent before care and support was provided. Where people lacked capacity best  interest decisions had been made involving families and staff from the service. We saw clear best interest  processes had been followed, for example, for people who were moving bedrooms.  The registered manager had a list of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) which were in place. A LPA is a legal  document that allows someone to make decisions for you, or act on your behalf, if you're no longer able to  or if you no longer want to make your own decisions. LPA's can be put in place for property and financial  affairs or health and welfare. This showed us the registered manager understood their responsibilities to act  within the legislation.  13 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   At the last two inspections we found a lack of person centred approach regarding some people's mealtime  regimes. We found there was not always an appropriate gap between breakfast and lunchtime, which  demonstrated a lack of person centred approach to care and support. At this inspection we found  improvements had been made. More thought had gone into planning mealtimes to meet people's individual needs.  People could eat at a time that suited them, and we saw appropriate gaps between meals for those  who needed assistance.   Everyone told us they were well looked after by staff. Comments included: ""They [staff] are all very good and  nice. The staff do treat me well, but I do think they work hard."" They [staff] are not so bad – they are easy to  get on with."" ""They [staff] are human – very friendly.""  ""The staff are very good here. I am very pleased with  the staff – they do their very best and are very helpful."" The staff are wonderful. They [staff] are brilliant and  all of them are very obliging."" A relative told us, ""It's fantastic here and Mum is so happy.""  We spoke with two visitors, who had turned up unannounced to see if the service would be suitable for their relative. They told  us they had been shown around everywhere and thought it was a warm, welcoming, friendly home with  plenty going on.    We observed care. People looked relaxed and comfortable around staff. There was a calm, friendly  atmosphere and we saw staff took time to sit and chat with people. We heard some good humoured banter  shared between people who used the service and staff which resulted in much laughter.  Staff took the time  to talk to people in between care and support tasks. This provided good companionship to people and  made for a lovely atmosphere.   Staff knew people well, for example, we asked them about one person whose care plan we had looked at.  They told us the person liked Opera music and fashion and always liked to be colour co-ordinated. We saw  this person looked well dressed and the entry in the daily records read, ""[Name] looks very smart this  morning with a pale yellow cardigan on, she chose her own clothes."" Person centred information on  people's likes, dislikes and history was maintained in care records which demonstrated staff had sought to  know about people to help provide individualised care and support.   Care staff were very considerate towards people, for example, at breakfast time one person complained  their coffee was 'horrible.' A care worker made them another drink and checked that one was alright before  continuing with their other duties. Another member of staff was sitting with three people in one of the  lounges and discussing with them what they might like to watch on TV. The final decision was a wildlife  programme.  People were able to express their views and were involved in making decisions about their care and support. During the inspection we saw staff asking people where they wanted to sit, what they wanted to eat and do.  Staff patiently waited for people to respond before taking action to meet their requests. Staff meeting  minutes showed that staff were constantly reminded of the importance of offering people choices, even if  they knew people's preferences well.  People had chosen décor, food and activities in the home.  This   14 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  demonstrated the service recognised the importance of listening and acting on people's views. People  confirmed they were able to make choices. For example they said they were able to get up and go to bed at  the times they wanted. One person said ""Yes, you can please yourself as to when you go to bed. I was very  tired yesterday- so I went to bed at 5:45pm – I know it was early but I was exhausted after so many visitors.""  Care plans showed that people and relatives had been consulted over care and support needs. Relatives  told us they felt involved in care and support decisions. We saw they were regularly contacted should  people's care needs changed. Relatives described communication as good.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the registered manager, staff,  people and visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service.  People were consistently treated with dignity and respect by staff.  We saw staff lower their voices to discuss  care and support tasks with people to maintain their confidentiality. Staff knocked on bedroom doors  before entering and ensured doors were closed during the provision of personal care.  If people's relatives  couldn't assist, the service supported people to attend hospital and other medical appointments.  This  helped reduce distress to people. This service was provided free of charge which demonstrated a caring  service.   We asked people about visiting times at the home. People told us their relatives and friends could visit at  any time and that they were unaware of any restrictions. One person said, ""Yes. I do get visitors. They can  visit at any time. There are no restrictions."" Another person said, ""Yes, my neighbours visit every week. There  are no restrictions as to when they visit.""  15 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People told us there was a personalised approach to care and support. For example people said they could  follow their preferred daily regimes. They said care was appropriate and met their individual needs.  A  relative said there had been an ""amazing transformation"" in their relatives' condition since they moved to  the home and their care needs were consistently met.  Another relative said, ""They do look after people  really really well"".   Electronic care records were maintained which showed people's needs had been assessed in a range of  areas including nutrition, mobility, social activities and personal care. Regular entries of the care provided  were inputted by care staff. We looked at these which demonstrated people had received the required care  and support interventions. Care and support plans were regularly updated and reviewed when people's  needs changed. This helped ensure responsive care.   The registered manager and deputy manager had attended an information session held by Bradford Council relating to the Accessible Information Standards. They understood their responsibilities in relation to this.  People's care plans gave clear information to staff about people's individual communication needs. For  example one person was partially sighted and there were clear instructions recorded on how to meet their  needs.  We saw staff adapting the way they communicated with people dependant on their individual  communication abilities.   People had access to a wide range of activities which were positively received by people. Comments  included: ""We have a bit of dancing, exercise with a ball."" ""You can go out for a walk if you want to."" ""We  have an entertainments girls who is always organising things. Mondays – we have music – we have a lady  who comes and plays the harp. Next month we have some Alpacas vising the home. We are going out to  Embsay railway. We have been to Scarborough, Bolton Abbey and the Carlisle railway. I like spending a lot of time in my own room – as I like to watch television. I also like sitting outside – when it's good weather."" On  the day of the inspection, people were celebrating one person's birthday in the main lounge near to the  office, during our visit. People were enjoying music, singing, drinks and birthday cake.  An activities co-ordinator was employed who worked four days a week. The programme of activities was on  display in the dining room, which included arts and crafts, light exercises, film afternoon and trips out. There  were also outside entertainers who came into the home. For example, every Monday evening there was a  sing- a-long with The Music Man, Golden Oldies on the first Thursday of every month and Healing Music. On  Friday mornings people could go out to visit Silsden Methodist Church. The activities co-ordinator also  arranged trips out using a local wheelchair accessible Taxi service. These trips included Garden Centres and  Bolton Abbey.   The service undertook one to one activities with some people so they did not become  socially isolated. We saw examples where staff had played music through a tablet computer to people  individually resulting in positive outcomes.  Links to a local Primary School had been developed with the children coming into the home at Christmas to  sing. Arrangements had since been made for four or five children to visit the home every other Thursday to   16 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  read to the people who lived there. There were photographs on display of various events and people's art  work was on display. We concluded people were being provided with a range of activities and social  opportunities to keep them occupied and meet their individual and diverse needs.   People we spoke with knew who to speak to if they had a complaint or any concerns. They all said they  would go the manager. People said they were satisfied with the service and had no complaints. The  complaints procedure was on display and care plans contained information about the support people may  need in order to make a complaint. One relative told us they would feel able to raise any concerns with the  registered manager or deputy manager. We looked at the complaints log and saw any complaints which had been made had been fully investigated and an outcome had been reached in each case. This showed us  concerns were taken seriously and dealt with appropriately. A significant number of compliments had been  received about the service and these were recorded so the service knew the areas in which it exceeded  expectations. For example one said, 'Thank you all so much for looking after my mum and for all your  kindness.' Another said, 'We would like to say all your staff are wonderful , caring and respectful, we cannot  thank you enough.'  Care planning demonstrated the service spoke to people and their relatives to help establish their end of life  needs and wishes.  We saw examples where this had resulted in care plans being produced to guide staff on  the care required.   17 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives told us they were highly satisfied with the service. No-one we spoke with raised any  concerns with us during our visit. One person said, ""Overall, I am happy with everything. The staff treat me  well.""  Another person said, ""It's very good here actually. Overall, I would definitely recommend this home to  people."" A third person said, ""Overall, I would recommend the home to other people. I am very pleased to be here. We have residents meetings once a month – they ask if we are happy with everything. I am very  satisfied with everything."" Another person said, ""I would recommend anyone to live here – as it is very nice.""  A relative said, ""Really really good, great place, the thing for me is the consistency of care.""  All of the staff we spoke with told us they would recommend Summerfield Private Residential Home as a  place to be cared for and to work. Comments included; ""It's a nice staff team, carers are good and interact  well with residents. I very much enjoy coming to work."" ""It's a nice, friendly home to work in. The manager is  out on the floor and is approachable. I enjoy coming to work and wouldn't work anywhere else."" Staff told  us the manager and provider were very responsive if anything was needed, for example, replacement of  carpets or new equipment.  People and staff both said the manager and provider were friendly, approachable and helped deal with any  issues or problems that arose. We observed a friendly, visibly person centred culture within the home with  staff working well together to help ensure people's care experience was as positive as possible.   Systems were in place to assess, monitor and improve the service. Audits took place in a range of areas  including infection control, the homes environment and medicines. An overall care audit reviewed people's  care and support needs including care plan documentation. The manager also conducted regular night  checks to provide assurance the home was operating safely at night. A staff member reviewed daily care  reports made by staff on the computerised system each day to determine whether they were appropriate  and ensure the required care and support could be evidenced.  Staff confirmed meetings were held and they felt able to have an open discussion with the management team.  The minutes of these meetings showed  the service was committed to continuous improvement, with quality and care issues discussed to help  improve performance.  We spoke with the registered manager and deputy manager who both demonstrated they were committed  to continuous improvement of the service.  They attended conferences, training and read care relating  publications to keep up-to-date with best practice guidance.  We saw they had produced 'case studies' to  demonstrate where the service had helped people to achieve a positive care or support outcome. This  included learning points to further improve the service.  For example one case study demonstrated how the  service had successfully supported a person to make contact with old friends and their place of worship. The details of this were recorded to aid further learning and improvement.  Another case study demonstrated  lessons learnt as a result of a delay in a person receiving their medicines. Incidents and accidents were  analysed for possible causes to aid improvements to the safety of the service.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including the local hospital to ensure joined up care for   18 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  people.  For example staff helped people attend appointments and there was a dedicated care plan given to hospital and other professionals so these agencies had concise information on people's needs.    People's views and feedback were sought and used to make improvements to the service. Monthly resident  meetings were held which had a good attendance. We looked at the minutes of the February 2018 meeting  which showed people felt happy safe and comfortable. People discussed a range of topics including  activities and meals. We saw people's feedback had been acted on. For example people were asked if they  would like local nursery school children to visit and they had said yes. This was currently being arranged  demonstrating people's views were being acted on.     The last resident and relative's survey had been completed in July 2017 and we saw the results were  extremely positive which was in line with our observations and feedback people gave us during the  inspection. Comments included; ""Excellent place, great staff and management."" Staff show outstanding  empathy with residents."" ""Staff always cheerful, smiling and polite."" ""Has been in three previous homes and  I am happiest with this one and so is he.""; ""Residents always come first."" ""Residents are happy here."" ""The  home is well kept."" ""If I had parents still alive this is the home I would bring them to if they ever needed one.  It's like home from home."" ""The residents get what they want."" ""Nothing is too much trouble.""  19 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  "

The provider of Oakleigh Lodge is registered to provide accommodation with personal care for up to 19 people. Oakleigh Lodge provides residential and respite care to people who have a learning disability, autism, and mental health condition or brain injury. Thirteen people were using the service at the time of our inspection, ten people lived in the main house and three people were accommodated in three of the four adjoining flats.  A registered manager was in post at the time of our inspection. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  At our last inspection of February 2015 the provider was not meeting one regulation that we assessed relating to  1 Oakleigh Lodge 	 19/02/2016  	  people’s care records. Improvements were also required regarding managing people’s medicines and providing additional staff training to ensure the care needs of people were met effectively. Further consideration of people’s capacity was needed to ensure their safety. The monitoring of the quality of the service needed strengthening to ensure any risks to people’s health and safety were managed. Following our inspection the provider sent us an action plan which highlighted the action they would take to improve. During this inspection we looked to see if improvements had been made and found that they had.  We saw that improvements had been made so that staff had the training they needed to administer people’s medicines safely.  People told us that they felt safe and we saw staff knew how to identify and report any concerns they had about harm or abuse.  People’s care needs were met by sufficient numbers of staff. Staff had access to a range of training which included additional specialist training to care for people who had complex needs. Staff felt their training and support helped them to develop the skills to meet people’s needs safely  We saw staff understood people's care and support needs and how to enable people to achieve their goals. People were satisfied staff cared for and supported them in the way they wanted. We saw staff were attentive and caring towards people. Staff used people's preferred  communication to ensure their individual choices were fully respected. They promoted people's dignity and privacy and supported people to follow their own interests.  Staff supported people to remain healthy and well. Staff monitored people's health and shared information effectively to make sure people received the right care and treatment. Staff followed the advice of health professionals so that any risks to their health could be reduced. People liked the meals provided and had been involved in planning and choosing what they ate.  People’s consent was sought before staff provided care or support to them. Where people were unable to consent to their care because they did not have the mental capacity to do so decisions were made in their best interests. Staff practices meant that people received care and support in the least restrictive way. The registered manager understood when people’s liberty may need to be restricted to ensure their safety so that any restrictions to people's liberty were lawfully applied.  We saw the provider had made a number of improvements since our last inspection. They had restructured the management team and improved their systems to monitor and review people's care. The provider had visited the home and carried out checks on all aspects of the service. He had provided opportunities for people, their relatives and the staff to share their experiences. He had made improvements so that people received a good quality service at all times.  2 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Summary of findings  Thefivequestionsweaskaboutservicesandwhatwefound  We always ask the following five questions of services.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This was an unannounced inspection which was undertaken on 5 and 8 January 2016 by one inspector.  We looked at the information we held about the provider and service. This included statutory notifications the registered manager had sent us. A statutory notification is information about important events which the provider is  required to send to us by law. We also received information from the local authority commissioners. Commissioners are people who work to find appropriate care and support services which are funded for by the local authority.  We met all of the people who lived at the home and spoke with seven people about their experiences. We observed the care of some people and observed their facial expressions and gestures to indicate their response to care. We also spoke with six relatives and a health professional by telephone.  We spoke with the provider, registered manager, deputy manager and three members of staff. We looked at the care and medicine records for four people. We also looked at the records about staffing, training, accidents, complaints. recruitment and the systems the registered manager and provider had in place to monitor the quality and safety of the service provided.  4 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  	  	"  At our last inspection in February 2015 we assessed that the provider had not ensured that staff had the necessary training to administer medicines via a peg feed, [a process where people needed to have their medicines administered directly into their stomach through a tube]. We assessed the arrangements and training in place at this inspection and found that improvements had been made. We saw staff had completed training in peg feeding. A staff member told us, “We had training from the external nurse and we have written guidelines to follow”.  One person told us staff,”Helped them with their medicines” and, “‘Make sure I have them every day”. We saw that the Medicine Administration Records (MAR) were correctly completed. We checked the balances of people’s medicines which matched their records. Records for the receipt and return of medicines were evident; an improvement since our last inspection. This is particularly important as some people had respite care and brought their medicines in from their own home. The Controlled Drugs register was completed correctly and these medicines were stored safely. Temperature charts were needed to ensure that the insulin was stored at the correct temperatures in the fridge. We looked at one person who was prescribed a medicine that thinned their blood. We saw the manufacturer’s supporting information was available. However due to the possible risks of a haemorrhage a written protocol with the MAR records would alert staff to the possible risks and the actions to be taken. The registered manager did this whilst we were on site to strengthen their procedures. We found that there was supporting information available that enabled staff to make a decision as to when to give medicines prescribed as ‘when necessary’. One person was receiving low doses of this indicating that other strategies to manage their agitation and anxiety were working. We suggested staff record this as part of the person’s monthly review to capture the fact that they had reduced the reliance on medicines.  People told us they felt safe living at the home. One person said, ""They (staff) are 100% at looking after me”. Another person told us, ""I can talk to staff if I was worried and they would help me”. A relative told us, “There were some safety issues that staff discussed with me and I’m happy with the arrangements now because [name of person] is kept safe”.  5 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  We saw that people who lived at the home were comfortable around the staff who supported them. They spontaneously sought staff out, spent time with them and from their smiles and expressions we found they were comfortable in the presence of staff. Relatives told us consistently that when their family member spent time at [the family] home, they were always happy to return to the care home. One relative said, “I can tell [name of person] is happy to go back because they get excited, smile and are eager to go. Once at the care home they settle straight back in; the staff are lovely”.  Staff were aware of the different types of abuse and the signs that might indicate a person was being abused. We saw they had taken action where they suspected someone was at risk of harm. This showed they had the confidence to raise their concerns and report them appropriately. One member of staff said, “We have done a lot of training around safeguarding which I really enjoyed and as a team we are much more confident”. We saw from training records that all of the staff had training and information on how to protect people from abuse.  Staff told us they were aware of whistle blowing procedures and we saw they had used these appropriately to raise concerns about people’s safety. At the time of our inspection two incidents were under investigation by the local authority. We saw the provider had taken interim action to protect people until these enquiries were concluded. A staff member told us, “I think any staff member would speak up if we had any concerns about the conduct of colleagues. We would be encouraged to”.  Staff were aware of how to manage risks to people's safety and wellbeing. A staff member told us, “Each person has a care plan and any risks to them are recorded so we have guidance about how we keep them safe”. We saw risk management plans were available for conditions such as epilepsy or dysphagia, [a condition that affects a person’s ability to swallow]. We saw that at mealtimes the staff supported a person in line with their care plan and that their food was appropriately prepared to avoid the risk of choking. Staff were able to tell us how they would respond to people’s epilepsy and how to manage their seizures. We found that plans described what staff should do in the event of a seizure and what medicines could be used in an emergency. We saw people had sensor equipment to alert staff to a seizure during the night. We saw staff supporting a person who had epilepsy and the support we observed  Good –––  Is the service safe?  matched what we saw in their care plan. We spoke with a person who needed equipment to aid their breathing during the night. They told us, “The staff check the machine is working and write it down”. We saw the person’s equipment was in working order and that a monitoring tool was in place which showed staff had consistently checked the equipment for the person’s safety.  Some people lived in the adjoining flats and received support from staff to help them develop their levels of independence. One person told us, “I like my flat and the staff help me with some things like money”. The person’s relative told us, “The staff have been remarkable; [person’s name] was vulnerable financially but they have sorted all that out”. One person had been identified as at risk living in the flats and their relative told us, “I’m confident now because staff recognised the dangers and moved [person’s name] as it was not safe them living on their own”.  We saw that there was a system in place for the registered manager to review accidents and incidents so that steps could be taken to help prevent them from happening again. The accident and incident logs had been reviewed and actions identified to reduce incidents. For example we saw that the provider had been proactive and had considered environmental factors. They had provided a ‘wet room’ so that there was less of a confined space when supporting a person with the aim of reducing their behaviours and anxieties.  The provider had arrangements in place to make sure suitable staff were employed. All staff we asked confirmed that checks were carried out before they were allowed to start work. This was confirmed from the staff files we looked at which contained references and checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). A DBS check identifies if a person has any criminal convictions or has been banned from working with people. This gave assurance that only suitable staff were employed to work in the home. A newly recruited staff member told us, “I had to produce references and I had to have a police check before I worked”.  People and staff we spoke with told us that there were enough staff to meet people’s needs. One person said, “If I need staff there is always someone to help me”. Another person from the flats told us, “Yes I have the help I need the staff come over regularly and help me”. Staff told us that there was enough staff to support people and we saw people's needs were met in a timely manner. We saw people were supported to go out to pre-arranged events and spontaneous events. We saw people some had been supported to shop for their groceries and other people attended appointments. A senior staff told us, “We plan in advance so we have sufficient staff to meet people’s commitments”. Staffing levels were kept under regular review and for some people this included additional staffing levels to meet their needs.Relatives told us that they visited frequently and had no concerns about the staffing levels.  6 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  routines and what’s important to [name of person], I am very confident in the staff”. Staff had also had training in managing dysphagia. We spoke with the external health professional involved in the management of dysphagia and they told us they had no concerns about staff following their recommendations. Staff told us they were happy with the training and support they received to help them meet people’s needs.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interest and as least restrictive as possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met.  We saw staff were seeking people’s consent. Staff could interpret people’s gestures, expressions and actions which showed them if the person agreed to the support being offered. People we spoke with told us that they made their own decisions about their care; what time they got up or went to bed, what they ate, and decisions about their personal care routines. The care records we looked at showed where people did not have the mental capacity to make decisions about aspects of their care, relevant people had been consulted to ensure decisions were made in the person's best interest. Decisions regarding some people’s health had been made appropriately using this process. A relative told us, “I was involved in discussions about [name of person] because they did not have capacity [to manage this aspect of their care], I’m happy their safety was prioritised”. Staff were able to describe how a lack of capacity may affect the way in which they supported people. One staff member told us, “We ask people’s consent before we do anything”. Staff could identify those people who lacked capacity and how to support them and this was reflected in people’s care plans.  "	  	"  People told us that staff supported them in the way they needed and wanted. One person said, ""They help me to cook for myself”. Another person said, “I look after myself but they [staff] help me with my medicine”. A relative told us, ""It’s brilliant the way [person’s name] has come on; much happier, calmer and has started to engage with people”. Another relative told us, “Staff do a first class job, it’s head and shoulders better than anywhere else we’ve been, the staff are very good and seem to understand people’s needs really well”.  Staff told us they had an induction when they started working at the home which included working different shifts so that they became familiar with people’s needs and routines. Staff told us their induction, support and training had increased which enabled them to care and support people effectively. We saw the provider had implemented the new Care Certificate to enhance their induction processes further. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip staff with the knowledge they need to provide people’s care. There was documentary evidence to show all of the staff had a development plan and training record. A staff member told us, “This is the best period the home has been through. Staff are more confident, we have a lot of training and regular support, spot checks on our competencies, everything is more in-depth and we know what we are doing”.  Staff had access to specialist advisors, such as a psychologist who provided guidance on the importance of providing structure for some of the people. Training records showed that staff had also completed varying levels of recognised qualifications in health and social care to a level to meet people’s needs. Additionally we saw staff had received more specialised training in autism. We saw that staff recognised the importance for some people to follow their chosen routines. We saw a person present repetitive behaviours to which staff responded consistently and positively. We saw they understood the person’s specific behaviours as sensitivity towards textures which impacted upon their tolerance of clothes. A staff member told us, “The autism training was great; I learned such a lot and it helped me to interpret people’s behaviour and understand how best to communicate with a person with autism”. A relative told us, “They show a real insight and understanding of [name of person]; they know their  7 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  Is the service effective?  Staff understood it was unlawful to restrict people's liberty unless authorised to do so. We saw people's movements were not restricted and they moved around the home freely, some people went out independently. Staff we spoke with had received training in respect of the MCA and DoLS. The registered manager demonstrated she understood when applications for a DoLS should be considered and was in the process of making an application to restrict one person’s liberty for their safety. The registered manager told us that care plans were being updated so that they all included reference to issues such as capacity, consent and DoLs so that staff had the information they needed to support people.  People told us they enjoyed the meals and that they had a choice of what they ate. One person said, “I really like the food”. We saw meetings with people had been used to discuss menus and we saw choices were available. A new cook had been employed and one of the people told us, “The food’s much better now; I like it and I get a choice”. We saw people were offered frequent drinks throughout the day. Staff spoken with were aware of risks associated with choking due to conditions such as epilepsy or dysphagia. We saw that they were vigilant when supporting people at mealtimes. The cook had information about people’s dietary needs such as diabetes, celiac and soft diets. People had regular opportunities to eat out, one person  said, “I can go out for lunch or a pub meal, I like that”. Some people had input from speech and language therapists [SALT] and dieticians to support them with their nutritional needs. There was guidance available for staff about people’s nutritional requirements and we saw this was followed consistently. Where a risk was evident people’s weight was monitored and records reflected this was monitored.  We saw people had access to a range of health professionals such as community learning disability nurses, psychiatrist, dentist, opticians and GP. We saw people were supported to access specialist health practitioners for their complex needs such as the epilepsy nurse. A person told us, “I see the doctor and other people who look after me”. Staff we spoke with were aware of people’s health needs and the preventative steps needed to promote people’s well-being. We saw that where people’s health deteriorated staff followed this up with relevant professionals. Hospital passports were being developed. This reflected the person’s health needs, management, their medicines and key health contacts. These are used to promote consistency for the person when using health services. Relatives told us they had no concerns about the management of people’s health needs and that they were always kept informed of any concerns.  8 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "	  	"  People we spoke with told us that they were happy at the home. One person told us, ""I love it here, staff are nice to me”. All of the relatives we spoke with were complimentary about the caring attitude of staff. One relative told us, ""[Persons name] is cared for brilliantly; the staff are really lovely with [persons name]”. Another relative told us, “There has been a vast improvement; [persons name] is happy, communicates much better, loves the staff, I am more than happy”.  We observed that there was a high level of engagement and interaction with people which was warm and inclusive and involved everyone having a say about their day. For example we heard staff speaking with people and seeing what they wanted to do and supporting them to do it. Two people went out shopping and another person attended an appointment. One person told us, “The staff are good, they’re friendly and if I want something they try and do it”. We saw people relaxing in the lounge with staff; some people enjoyed conversing with staff, other people we saw enjoyed a more tactile approach; holding staff’s hand or staff stroking their arm. We concluded that staff were caring in their approach to people, they were patient and unrushed and we saw that where people needed one to one support this was carried out in an unobtrusive way.  Staff we spoke with were able to explain people's preferred method of communication and how they would express themselves if they were unhappy, sad, angry or frustrated. We saw there was good detail in people’s plans to guide staff and that staff used this well to interact with people. For example we saw some extremely positive interactions between staff and people they supported. A staff member used gestures and repeated key phases when supporting a person. The person responded with hugs and smiles. The staff member clearly had good insight into how the person communicated their feelings and wishes and this ensured the staff member supported them in the way they wanted.  Staff had a good understanding of people’s personalities and used this well when engaging them. We saw for example they were patient and calm when people became anxious or agitated and knew the best way to comfort them. We saw staff had developed personalised care and support routines with people which took account of their needs. For example a detailed bedtime routine was in place for one person to help them settle and create  9 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  consistency and a calm approach. We also saw that a detailed plan was in place for another person, recognising their heightened agitation in the morning. A staff member told us, “We understand the signs of agitation and try to reduce the level of distress when delivering their care”. We found staff knew how to support people in a caring, person-centred way.  We saw staff understood what mattered to people and how they expressed this. For example we saw one person had their personal objects with them at all times. We saw staff reassured them where these items were. A staff member told us, “These are the person’s ‘comforts’ and are really important to them, we make sure they have them”. This ensured people’s views mattered and that staff listened to them and communicated with them in a way they could understand.  We saw some people had been involved in the recruitment interviews for new staff. One person told us they had enjoyed this. A staff member told us, “It’s important people have a say about who is working with them, I think it builds trust and shows people we are interested in their views”.  The relationships between staff and people receiving support demonstrated that staff knew people well and we saw examples of where staff had responded to people’s needs in a caring and compassionate way. For example staff had spent time with individual people discussing their feelings which showed concern for their wellbeing. One staff member told us, “The person was sad, It’s important to listen to people”. This showed staff had empathy for people and were proactively supporting people to express their views. It also showed staff tried to promote people’s self-esteem because we saw they had helped people to reflect on their achievements.  Some of the people required support with their personal care and people indicated both verbally and with a hand gesture and smile, they were well cared for. People were wearing clothing they liked and had chosen and a person said staff helped them to shave. A relative told us, “[Persons name] needs a lot of support with personal care; staff have listened and acted on this because they are purchasing an electric shaver”. These actions showed staff were promoting people’s dignity and independence.  Our conversations with staff showed they spoke about people in positive terms. Staff told us they had discussed values so that they understood the principles of good care.  Good –––  Is the service caring?  They had a good understanding of the need to promote privacy, respect and dignity and we saw they did this in their daily interactions with people. We saw some very positive responses from staff to protecting people’s dignity. One example showed a staff member instinctively covering a person who had removed their clothing which showed they respected the person’s need to be protected in this way. Another example showed us that staff respected people’s personal space and their possessions. There was clear decision making which resulted in not making judgements about the person’s behaviour.  Staff we spoke with were aware that some people could feel lonely or become isolated in the flats. We observed staff interacted with people and checked their well-being. People told us they spent periods in the main house but  enjoyed the privacy of their flat. They had no concerns about the approach of staff. One person said, “They do care and make sure I am alright. Another person said, “I can talk to them about any worries, they’re good like that”.  People were supported to maintain their independence. One person told us, “I look after my money but staff help me to do it”. We saw staff were attentive when supporting people with their shopping skills. Two people told us how they had their own keys and they locked their room or flat when they went out. We heard from people that they cleaned and tidied their own rooms and took part in shopping and cooking meals. Two people we spoke with confirmed they liked to be independent.  Staff were able to describe to us how they could seek input from advocacy services to represent people’s interests where they were unable to do this for themselves.  10  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  "	  	"  Some people were able to tell us that they were happy with the care and support they received and had been involved in discussing their care. One person said, ""They talked to me about what I want”. Relatives consistently said that they were included in regular discussions about people’s care. One relative said, “I think they are very good at communicating issues, they listen and we decide together what is the best approach”.  Some people were unable to communicate their preferences, wishes and choices but we saw from care plans that attempts had been made to ensure their care plan was personal to them. For example we saw plans contained details about people’s preferred routines. This ensured staff understood how to interpret and understand people’s wishes and support them in the way they wanted. Our discussions with staff showed that they knew people well and understood their needs and preferences. We saw they had used this information to inform people’s care plans so making them more personalised to the person. For example we saw that people’s routines had been recorded so that staff knew how to support people at key times of the day such as getting up or going to bed.  Staff told us some people could put themselves or others at risk of harm if they became anxious. We saw there was a detailed behaviour management plan in place for staff to follow to support one person with their behaviours. All of the staff we spoke with were aware of the behavioural guidelines in place and were able to describe how the person was supported. We saw that specialist advice from external healthcare professionals had been included and followed in order to reduce the person’s anxieties. We saw staff managed and supported the person with their behaviours. The person told us, “I’m happy with the staff, they are very good to me”.  We saw that staff had platforms to regularly review and monitor people's needs. For example staff told us they had an in-depth handover in which they discussed the wellbeing of each person. One member of staff said, ""We share information about people’s needs, any concerns or incidents and staff are delegated to follow this up”. We saw examples where staff had taken action where people’s needs had changed; for example one person had visited the hospital for medical tests. Staff told us that they recorded information about people’s care in their daily  11  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  diaries and we saw each person's activities, their behaviours and communication provided an overall picture of the person's wellbeing. These were being checked by senior staff to see if any changes were needed to people’s care plans. Relatives told us they had attended review meetings and we saw that external professionals contributed to this process. For example we saw a specialist visit the home to review the changing needs of two people on the day we inspected. A staff member told us, “We do involve relevant key professionals to obtain their advice on our care approach”. We saw that this had been done promptly in response to the needs of the two people. Our discussions with senior staff showed they were well informed about the care interventions people needed. We also saw they ‘led by example’ by for instance explaining to staff how to distract/or diffuse situations so that people received a consistent response to their needs.  People were supported to access social activities which they had expressed an interest in. One person told us they attended a weekly evening group which they enjoyed. Another person had been supported to attend a day centre. We saw that where people had an interest in work or education they had been supported to find a work placement. A relative told us, “It’s been great for [person’s name], is growing in confidence, showing more responsibility and developing skills”. We saw that people were engaged in things they enjoyed such as drawing, listening to music, watching DVD’s and playing games. A pool table had been purchased which people told us they enjoyed. One person told us how they liked to care for the chickens in the garden. “I look after them every day”. We saw some people enjoyed activities on their laptops. A sensory room was available where people could relax and enjoy music and visual stimulation. People told us they had frequent trips out for lunch or to the pub. People had enjoyed a variety of social events; trips to the theatre, football matches, social clubs in the community and discos. We saw that there was good evidence that people’s interest and aspirations were being addressed. One person told us, “There’s a lot of things to do and I go out more”.  People we spoke with knew who they could talk to if they had any complaints. One person told us, “If I had any complaints I would tell the staff, but they ask me if everything is alright so if things need doing it would be done then”. Relatives told us they had confidence in the staff and management and would represent their son or daughter if they were unhappy about something. The  Good –––  Is the service responsive?  provider had a complaints procedure in formats people could understand which they had shared with people and their families. A record of how complaints had been addressed and resolved was evident.  People told us they were supported to maintain relationships with people who were important to them.  Relatives told us that they were always made welcome. A relative told us, “Whenever I visit I see the staff are always caring for people, and people are happy”. Another relative told us, “The staff have lovely relationships with people, I’m fully confident this is a great service and the staff are a credit”.  12  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "	  	"  At our last inspection in February 2015 we assessed that the provider had not maintained accurate records related to people’s needs and this had resulted in omissions in some people’s care. We had also found that the well-led section required improvement. The quality monitoring systems at that time had failed to ensure that shortfalls relating to medicine management were identified. There was also a lack of safeguards in place for monitoring and managing people’s health conditions and a risk of people receiving unsafe or inconsistent care because records detailing how people’s risks should be managed were not up to date. The review of accidents and incidents had not been recorded accurately or analysed to ensure appropriate follow up action was taken. We inspected the care records related to people’s care during this inspection and found that improvements had been made and the provider had met the regulation.  We found that the provider had improved their checking processes and audits so that people had their medicines as they were prescribed and that these were administered safely by trained staff. We saw that people’s care plans had been reviewed to ensure that they were current and up-to-date. We found that care plans identified risks to people’s health, welfare and safety and provided guidance to staff as to what they needed to do to support the people. We looked at the monitoring tools in place and saw that staff were using these consistently to monitor their interventions so that any deterioration in people’s health could be identified and acted upon in a timely way. We heard from staff that the improved care records and monitoring tools provided them with the information they needed.  The provider had introduced a new system to analyse the number and type of accidents and incidents. We saw they had reviewed these regularly to identify any patterns or trends with a view to reducing risks. However further improvement was needed to ensure these records reflected how decisions about people’s safety had been reached. For example whether some incidents required reporting to other agencies such as safeguarding. We also saw that staff did not always consistently record their  13  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  findings accurately or complete a body map. This is needed to show checks had been made on the person involved in an accident or incident. The registered provider told us after our inspection that they had addressed this.  We found that platforms were in place to help staff share information on a daily basis. A staff member told us, “The handover is much more in-depth so we discuss what actions need to be taken to follow up any issues”. We saw staff were clear about their roles and responsibilities because the provider had implemented a written hand over record. A delegation system was in place so that staff were accountable for actions and tasks to be completed. Senior staff were supported in their leadership roles and had been provided with training to develop their skills for their tasks and responsibilities. One staff said, ""We have more responsibility which is good, we get a lot of support and guidance and I’ve had training so I feel confident in my role”. We saw that regular meetings had taken place at all levels within the organisation to ensure good communication which provided assurance that the service was being well led.  There had been some significant changes to the management of the service. This had included a new registered manager and a deputy manager who were supported by a team of senior care staff. There was a clear leadership structure which we found that staff understood. One staff said, “We have been through some unsettling times but things are so much better now, I feel really well supported”. The provider had also provided administrative support to the home on a daily basis and we heard from senior staff that this had ‘freed up’ their time and improved their capacity to focus on their responsibilities.  All the people we spoke with indicated they knew and liked the registered manager. One person said, ""She’s 100% and things are much better here now”. Relatives told us that stability of management had been their main area of concern. However they all reported there had been significant improvements and that they had confidence in the registered manager and provider. One relative said, “It’s always been a fantastic service for us, the recent changes in management were a worry but I think there has been lots of improvements so I am happy”. Another relative told us, “I am extremely happy and confident with them, they communicate with me, and [name of person] is happy and settled I have peace of mind”. We saw the registered manager was very much part of the staff team and saw she  Good –––  Is the service well-led?  spent time with people who lived at the home. She knew people well and had begun to get to know some of the families via planned meetings to discuss their son or daughter. One relative told us, “She’s very approachable and I have spoken with her”.  Staff had opportunities to contribute to the running of the service people received through regular staff meetings and supervisions. Staff spoke positively about the registered manager who had worked in the service for a few months. One staff member told us, ""There has been a lot of improvements and the new manager has continued this work”. Another staff told us, ""I think the home is well managed; we work well together, communication is better between staff and management and the management team work on the floor so see what is needed”.  Staff understood how they could report any concerns about the care offered by colleagues via the whistle blowing procedures and we saw the provider had taken effective action in response. The provider had increased the opportunities available to staff to be more involved and able to contribute to developments. One staff said, “We have worked hard and people here now have an even better service; more structured care, better social opportunities, it is a nice place for them to live”. A person living there told us, “Lots has changed; staff, managers and we do more stuff”. We saw that staff meetings, handovers and training had been provided to staff.  The provider had visited the home regularly and taken a proactive approach to monitoring and checking all aspects of the service provision. For example we saw he talked with people, staff and families to obtain their feedback. We saw  he carried out checks on records, monitoring tools and the environment. A written record of the findings of these checks was available. The registered manager confirmed any actions needed as a result of the provider’s visits were addressed. The provider told us, “I am much more actively involved and like to check that the tasks we identify are addressed, I am very confident our systems now are robust”. We saw documentary evidence that spot checks had also been carried out by the registered manager during various points of the night to ensure care was being delivered appropriately.  We found that the provider and registered manager’s systems ensured they had a good oversight of the home. This had resulted in a number of improvements for the benefit of people who lived there. For example people’s safety was reviewed, people’s goals and aspirations were being addressed and there was evidence of increased social activities and opportunities. The layout of the lounge and dining areas had been altered and we saw this provided a much calmer environment in which people could relax. The provider had reviewed staff's training needs and we saw they had undertaken additional specialist training to meet people’s complex needs effectively. They had employed a new cook and people reported that the meals were ‘lovely’ and that the choice of meals had improved. We saw surveys had been used to obtain people’s views. Feedback from people and their relatives about the quality of the service was positive. We found that the provider had implemented actions identified as needed by us [Care Quality Commission] and the local authority who had also informed us that improvements had been noted.  14  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "

The Limes provides accommodation and support to a maximum of 46 older people some of whom were  living with dementia. It is not registered to provide nursing care. At the time of our inspection there were 44  people living in the home.  At the time of our inspection visit there was registered manager in post. A registered manager is a person  who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they  are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  We last inspected this service on 13 and 14 June 2016 and found the provider was in breach of three  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. We issued  requirement notices in respect of these breaches.  Following our inspection in June 2016, the provider sent  us an action plan to tell us about the actions they were going to take to meet these regulations. They told us  they would be compliant  with two of the  regulations by September 2016 and with a further regulation by  November 2016.  We carried out this inspection to check if the improvements had been made in order to achieve compliance  with the regulations. At this inspection we found insufficient improvements had been made and governance arrangements in the home were not effective enough to rectify the breaches found at the previous  inspection. The provider was still in breach of regulations for: safe care and treatment, safeguarding service  users from abuse and improper treatment, and good governance. We found that there had been a  deterioration in the quality of care in other areas, which meant the provider was in breach of a further five  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This meant that  risks to people had increased.    Full information about CQC's regulatory response to any concerns found during inspections is added to  reports after any representations and appeals have been concluded.  We found people were not being provided with safe care. Risks to people's health and safety were not  always identified. We found in cases where risks had been identified, that insufficient action had been taken  to manage and mitigate the risk of any further harm. The systems in place had also not identified risks to  people from the premises. The service remained in breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People were not always protected from improper treatment and had been subject to inappropriate  restraint. Systems and processes in place were not effective to ensure people living in the home were  adequately protected from improper treatment. The service remained in breach of Regulation 13 of the   2 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Recruitment processes were not robust and did not fully mitigate the risks of employing staff unsuitable to  their role. The registered manager had not taken action to fully assure themselves that staff employed were  fit and proper.  This was a breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014.  Staff did not always understand the importance of seeking consent from people living in the home. The  service did not fully adhere to the mental capacity act which meant people's rights to provide consent were  not always fully protected.  This was a breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People's nutritional and hydration needs were not always met. People did not always receive adequate  support with their meals or access to suitable foods. This was a breach of Regulation 14 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People were not always supported in a caring manner that promoted their dignity and independence.  People's privacy was not always respected. Their independence and ability to choose for themselves was  not always promoted.  This was a breach of Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014.  The care provided did not to take in to account people's individual needs and preferences. Staff did not  always support people to make their preferences known. Where preferences where known these were not  always acknowledged or provided for.  Care plans did not always contain sufficient information or guidance, including on how people wanted to be cared for. The activities on offer did not always meet people's  individual needs which meant they were not always inclusive. This was a breach of Regulation 9 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.   The provider had failed to implement effective systems to assess, monitor and improve the quality and  safety of the service. This had resulted in some people experiencing poor care and support. They had also  failed to maintain an accurate and complete record in respect of each person who used the service.  Necessary improvements to the service had not been made. The culture in the home was not always person  centred or respectful. This had not been identified by the provider or management in the service and  consequently improvements in this area were required. The service remained in breach of Regulation 17 of  the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Improvements were required in the safe management of medicines. We found systems in place were not  always effective at ensuring people received medicines that were appropriate to their needs. Guidance for  'as required' medicines did not provide adequate guidance for staff regarding when this should be  administered.   Staffing levels appeared adequate in the home, although we observed that staff could be better deployed to help ensure people's needs were fully met.   There was varied feedback regarding the competency and expertise of the staff. Staff training was in place  although not all staff had attended this training, and training rates for some individual staff members were  very low.    People could access their local GP however we found staff did not always advocate on behalf of people to   3 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  access other health care services.   There was mixed feedback regarding how the service responded to complaints, although where complaints  were recorded we saw the manager had investigated and responded.   The overall rating for this service is 'Inadequate' and the service is therefore in 'Special measures'. Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months. The  expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant  improvements within this timeframe.  If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any  key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of  preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve. This service will continue to be kept  under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another  inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is  still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from  operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their  registration.  For adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  4 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Inadequate    Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    	  The service was not safe.  Risks to people's wellbeing and safety were not always identified  and actions to minimise risks were not always taken.  People were not always protected from improper treatment and  had been subject to inappropriate restraint.  Recruitment processes were not robust and did not fully mitigate the risks of employing staff unsuitable to their role.  	  The service was not always effective.   Not all staff had not received sufficient training to ensure they  could meet the needs of people living in the home.  The home was not working within the requirements of the MCA.  Staff did not always seek people's consent.  People were not adequately supported with their nutritional  needs.  	  The service was not always caring.  Staff did not always interact with people in a caring manner.  People's dignity and privacy was not always promoted.   	  The service was not always responsive.  The care provided did not always meet people's individual needs and preferences, including the provision of activities.   Care records did not provide sufficient guidance to staff to help  ensure the care provided was person centred.  5 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Inadequate    	  The service was not well led.  There were widespread and significant shortfalls in the way that  the service was being managed.  Whilst there were some systems in place to monitor the quality of the service, these were not effective.  The culture in the home was not always person centred or  respectful.  6 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017     The Limes  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 25 and 26 July 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was carried out by  two inspectors and an expert by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service.   Before we carried out the inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service. This included  statutory notifications that the provider had sent us. A statutory notification contains information about  significant events that affect people's safety, which the provider is required to send to us by law. We also  contacted the local authority adult safeguarding team and the quality assurance team for their views on the  service. We looked at the action plan the provider had sent us after their last inspection.  During our inspection we spoke with five people using the service and eight relatives of people using the  service. We spoke with seven members of staff. This included the registered manager, deputy manager, two  care staff, two senior members of care staff, and a kitchen assistant.   Not everyone living at The Limes was able to speak with us and tell us about their experiences of living in the home. We observed how care and support was provided to people and how people were supported to eat  their lunch time meal.  We looked at nine people's care records, three staff recruitment files and staff training records. We checked  the medicines records for eight people. We looked at quality monitoring documents, accident and incident  records, and other records relating to the management of the service.  7 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our previous inspection on 13 and 14 June 2016 we identified a breach Regulation 12 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This was because risks were not always  identified and action was not always taken to keep people safe. At this inspection on 25 and 26 July 2017 we  found sufficient improvements had not been made and additional concerns were identified.   Risks to people had not always been identified and managed appropriately. Two people living in the home  required specialised diets because they were at risk of choking. Food records for one person showed that  staff had failed to provide foods that were suitable for their needs and meant there was an increased risk of  harm to the person. For another person on the first day of our inspection visit we saw they were given a  dessert that was not suitable and they started to experience difficulties while eating this. We intervened to  ensure the person did not eat any more of this dessert and asked the registered manager to respond  urgently to this risk. For a third person we found they had been experiencing unstable diabetes and  sufficient actions had not been taken to assess and manage this risk. For a fourth person, we found they had been consistently refusing their medicines over a three week period and sufficient actions had not been  taken to assess and manage this risk.   At this inspection we also found sufficient and timely actions were not taken to ensure people who were  nutritionally at risk were safe. For one person, records showed they had lost 2.8kg between 31 March 2017  and 30 June 2017. Food charts were completed between 29 June and 1 July 2017 which showed the person  was eating very little. No additional actions to assess or manage this risk, such as an increased monitoring of this person's weight loss, food intake, or referral to a dietician had taken place. For a second person we saw  they had lost 4.2kg between the 16 June 2017 and 24 July 2017. Whilst the service had taken some action to  respond to this risk, such as requesting referrals to a dietician. We found that their three day food chart from  6 July 2017 to 8 July 2017 showed they were eating small amounts and this was discontinued despite the  person being assessed at a high risk of malnutrition. This meant staff could not sufficiently monitor and  respond to this risk.   Risks to people from deterioration of their skin conditions were not adequately monitored or managed. We  found that for two people at high risk of pressure sores, regular repositioning as detailed in their associated  risk assessments was not taking place as frequently as required. We observed one of these people sitting in  the lounge for long periods of time without the required repositioning taking place. A third person's risk  assessment stated they required support with repositioning every three hours at night. The registered  manager was unable to provide us with any documentation showing this was taking place. This meant no  monitoring of the person's repositioning was taking place so that the level of risk could be adequately  assessed. Staff we spoke with did not always demonstrate full understanding of this risk and how to manage it.   Risk assessments did not always identify risks or provide staff with sufficient guidance. For example, in  relation to the management of people's diabetes, required specialist diets and the risks of choking, and non- compliance with medicines.   8 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  There was a system in place for the reporting and analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred in the  service. However, we found this was not always effective and did not always ensure satisfactory actions had  been taken in response to identified risks. For example, we saw one person had fallen three times in June  2017. The registered manager had recorded that in response to this risk a referral to a falls clinic and  occupational therapy had been made. However, there was no evidence that these referrals had been made.  We asked the registered manager and deputy manager about this who told us they had experienced  difficulties making these referrals and were unable to confirm that these had been made. This meant we  were concerned that the identified action to manage this risk had not been taken.   At our last inspection in June 2016 we found some risks to people from the premises were not adequately  managed or risk assessed. Whilst we saw regular health and safety checks were now being carried out, we  found there was a continued risk relating to the management of the premises. On the first day of our  inspection visit we found people had access to the garden of the home where a shed had been left open  with tools and paint, and other equipment that posed a risk to people's safety. Records showed that cold  water temperatures in the home were above the recommended range which meant there was an increased  risk of legionnaire bacteria growing. This risk had not been sufficiently identified and suitable action to  address this risk had not been taken.   The above information meant the provider continued to be in breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.   At our previous inspection carried out in June 2016, we found that the provider was in breach of Regulation  13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This was because there  was a lack of systems and staff understanding to ensure safeguarding incidents were identified and reported to the local authority safeguarding team as required. At this inspection we found whilst improvements in  reporting safeguarding incidents had been made, continued concerns remained.  During our inspection visit we witnessed two incidents where people living in the home were subject to  improper treatment which included a disproportionate use of control and restraint. There was at least one  other staff member present during this incident but they did not intervene. We reported this incident to the  registered manager during the inspection and they were not aware this incident had taken place, or aware  of any other concerns in the service regarding improper treatment or restraint. This meant we were  concerned that the systems and processes in place were not effective and people living in the home were  not adequately protected from improper treatment. Therefore the provider remained in breach of  Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  At this inspection in July 2017 we identified a breach of Regulation 19 of (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014. This was because the recruitment processes in place were not robust and did not fully mitigate the  risks of employing staff unsuitable to their role.   We found where issues had been raised through recruitments checks no risk assessments had been carried  out to ensure that staff employed were of fit and proper character.     We found improvements were required in the safe management of medicines. Records for one person  showed staff had administered a medicine they were allergic to and this had impacted on their health.  Whilst the registered manager had taken action in response to this we were concerned that staff practice in  the home had allowed this to occur. For another person we saw they had been administered a medicine  that they were unable to take due to swallowing difficulties. Whilst staff had subsequently taken action, we  were concerned that the actions they had taken had not sufficiently explored the risk to the person and had   9 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  meant that the medicine was administered covertly with no thorough consideration and consultation in  place.   People's medicine administration records showed medicines were administered as prescribed and were  stored safely and securely. One of the medicine administration records we checked did not have available  written information to show staff how and when to administer as required medication. We found for other  people this information was in place but did not always contain sufficient guidance for staff on when to  administer these medicines. We checked three medicines and saw the stock count was accurate.  People told us they received their medicines when required.  One person said, ""I get my tablets in the  morning and the evening and they watch me take them."" Another person told us, ""They always make sure  that I get my tablets in the morning and at night.""   None of the people, relatives, or staff raised concerns about staffing levels in the home. One person said,  ""[Staff] are pretty good at turning up if I press my buzzer when I want something."" This person gave a  demonstration of this to us, pressing their call bell, with a member of staff responding promptly. A second  person told us, ""If [I] need any help then there is someone about to help me."" However, during our  inspection we observed that although there appeared to be sufficient staff they were not always deployed  effectively to ensure people were adequately supported, for example over the lunchtime period.   A staffing dependency tool was used to help the registered manager establish how many staff were required  to meet people's needs. We looked at this and saw it reviewed how many people had high dependency  needs in the home and involved asking people's and staff member's opinions of staffing levels in the home.  We reviewed the staffing rosters for the last two weeks and saw the home was staffed to the levels the  provider had deemed as required to meet people's needs.  10 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care home and hospitals are  called Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the  principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty was  being met.  People and relatives we spoke with told us not all the staff asked for their consent before providing support.  One person said, ""Not all of them ask if it's alright to do things for me. Some do. I eat whatever I'm given as I  don't mind."" A second person told us, ""Some of the carers do ask if it's alright to do things for you, but not all of them. They have to do what they have got to do."" A relative said, ""Some of the staff ask [name's] consent  and some don't but understanding of the question is very limited.""  We saw that relatives were being asked to provide consent for people without staff checking that they had  the legal authority to do so. For example, we saw relatives were signing for consent to the service sharing  information about people. On another occasion we saw that family members had been advised that their  consent would be sought before staff took people out of the home on trips.   People had risk assessments in place that stated people did not have full capacity to make decisions about  their care, however there were no mental capacity assessments in place to support these risk assessments  and provide clarity regarding what specific decisions they could not make. We found for one person a  mental capacity assessment had been made that they lacked the capacity to make decisions regarding their diet. Records showed that actions had been taken to restrict the person's diet however we later received  conflicting information from the provider that the person had capacity in regards to their diet. We spoke  with this person who told us they understood why the restrictions had been put in place but had not felt  involved or consulted about this decision. This meant we were not confident the home was fully adhering to  the MCA.   The registered manager had made applications for authorisations under DoLS. However, we found in the  home's development plan they had stated that all people with a diagnosis of dementia required an  application to be made. Having a diagnosis of dementia does not automatically mean a person lacks  capacity to consent and that an authorisation is required. Each person's circumstances must be assessed  and considered individually, including the individual's ability to consent.  We were concerned that this  blanket approach to applications demonstrated that the registered manager did not fully understand their  responsibilities under DoLS and applications for authorisations were being made without following the   11 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  proper legal processes and assessing if they were required.   The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.       People were not always supported with their nutritional and hydration needs. We observed during both  days of our visit that people in the home did not always have drinks readily available to them and were not  always supported to drink enough. We observed the support provided over lunch time and saw not all  people were supported adequately with their meals; as a consequence we observed some people did not  receive enough to eat. For one person we found they required nutritional supplements but their medicine  administration records showed these had been out of stock and had not been given for eleven days. This  meant the person had not received the right support to ensure their nutritional needs were met.  We also found that meals were not provided in a way that ensured people's nutritional needs or preferences  were met. For example, one person's care plan stated they preferred to eat using their fingers and for staff to  provide finger foods. We observed on the 25 July 2017 that the meal provided to the person was not finger  food and although they attempted to try to eat this with their fingers this was not possible. We reviewed the  food records for this person and saw they were consistently not provided with suitable finger foods. This  meant that they were at risk of not eating their meals. For a second person we saw their care plan and  associated risk assessment said to offer regular high calorie snacks. Their discharge letter from the local  nutrition and dietetics department advised they should have a small and frequent meal pattern. During our  inspection we observed regular high calorie snacks and a frequent meal pattern were not provided, which  meant their nutritional needs were not being met.  The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 14 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.       We received mixed comments about the food provided. One person told us, ""I'm very happy with the food I  get. I have no complaints about it."" Whilst another person said, ""The food could be much better, it's not  terribly appetizing. It needs to be more like home cooking."" Whilst some relatives we spoke with raised  concerns about the support their relatives received with their nutrition and hydration. One relative said, ""We  have concerns about [name's] food and fluid intake which we don't think is monitored properly. We bring in  more drinks."" Another relative told us, ""[Name] does not eat much or drink much. I try to help but they do  not want that they want to do it themselves. I have asked for help from a dietician, but I have not had any  feedback from them.""   People and relatives provided us with varied feedback regarding the competency and expertise of the staff.  One person told us, ""I think they know what they are doing."" Whilst another person said, ""Some know what  they are doing and some are not so well trained."" A third person told us that a new member of staff had  supported them with specific care task involving equipment which they had no experience of. They said the  member of staff was able to undertake this task with instruction from themselves. A relative told us, ""Some  of the staff know what they are doing and some don't.""   Staff we spoke with told us their training was up to date. One staff member told us it was, ""Always good to  refresh."" Staff told us training provided was via online courses and that it provided them with the  information they needed. However, from our conversations and findings from this inspection we were  concerned about how effective the training and systems in place were in order to ensure all staff had the  knowledge required to meet people's needs. For example, not all staff were able to tell us about the MCA  and some showed poor knowledge of the prevention of pressure ulcers.   12 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Staff training records showed training rates for each topic that staff had training in, for example first aid or  fire safety, were over seventy percent in the majority of areas. However, it showed some individual staff  members had poor training rates. For example one staff member only had a training attendance rate of five  percent and another two staff were on seventeen percent. We reviewed the audits for training and found this issue did not appear to have been sufficiently identified and there was no clear plan in place to address this.  New staff told us they received an induction, which consisted of training and shadowing other experienced  staff prior to working in the home. One staff member told us, ""I was well prepared."" We saw there was a staff  induction checklist in place to ensure staff had been told about the care required and their responsibilities.   People told us they could access their local general practitioner. One person said, ""If I need the doctor I can  see one, but I very rarely require one."" Another person told us, ""I can see the doctor when I need to."" Whilst  records showed people were supported to access their local doctor we were not always confident that the  service was sufficiently advocating on people's behalf for access to other health care professionals, such as  speech and language therapists or falls specialists.  13 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were not always supported in a caring manner that promoted their dignity and independence.  During our visits we saw a number of incidents when staff did not act in a caring way. For example, we  observed the support provided over lunch time and saw staff standing over people when supporting them  to eat rather than sitting alongside them. We also observed staff assisting people with no acknowledgement  or interaction. On another occasion one staff member was assisting two people to eat at the same time. On  a fourth occasion we observed a staff member encouraging a person to drink a previously served hot drink  that had gone cold. We observed that staff member had noted the drink was cold but continued to  encourage the person to drink it, and did not offer a fresh drink.   One person was sitting in the communal lounge and we saw them sleeping on and off throughout the day.  We observed that they were often doubled over and slumped on the table in front of them, at one point with  their hair in their food, for long periods of time. Whilst staff were present in the communal lounge we noted  staff did not consistently respond to this person in order to support them to sit upright or offer them  assistance to their room so they could sleep comfortably. We noted that this compromised the person's  dignity.   We found people's privacy was not always respected, for instance we observed a staff member pulling up a  person's trousers and administering cream to their legs whilst in they were sitting in the communal lounge,  in full view of other people during their lunch time meal. They did not offer the opportunity for privacy,  compromising both privacy and dignity for the person.  People's independence and choices were not always promoted and respected. At lunchtime we noted that  one person was wearing a coloured plastic apron around their neck to protect their clothing. They  repeatedly tried to remove it during the meal. A staff member intervened and stopped the person from  doing this several times, tucking the protector in. We found that whilst the staff member's intentions may  have been to ensure the person kept clean this did not fully acknowledge or support their right to remove  the protector.    The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.        We received mixed feedback from people and relatives regarding how caring staff were. One person told us,  ""They look after me well here and they are all very nice."" Another person said, ""The majority treat me with  respect."" A third person told us, ""Some of the staff are caring and some are not so caring. The same applies  to the way they speak to you. Some are more respectful than others."" A relative said, ""There are some caring  staff here who work very hard, but there are not enough staff so they under a lot of pressure. Some of the  agency staff are not so good. The same applies to the way they speak with [name]. It is the way in which  things are missed."" Whilst a second relative told us, ""The care here is variable the permanent staff are more  caring and thoughtful, whereas the contract staff are less so. I needed to chase them over [name's] personal  care of their nails which were dirty. They said that was because [name] had had chocolate cake. They did   14 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  clean them, but even now [name's] nails are too long and need trimming. You do have to remind them to do things.""  15 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   The care provided did not to take in to account people's individual needs and preferences. We found  systems and staff did not fully support people to make their preferences known. For example, there was no  additional support in place, such as picture menus, for people to help them make decisions regarding what  they wanted to eat and to communicate this. We observed that without this support people struggled to  understand staff member's questions and make their preferences known. We observed on another occasion  a staff member provided a person with a hot drink without communicating with the person and asking them what they wanted.   We found actions were not always taken by staff or the management to ensure people's needs were met and reasonable adjustments made in order to promote people's independence.  We found one person required  additional support to regain their independence. There was no system in place to support this and records  did not show this support was being given. We asked the registered manager what support was being  provided by staff and were provided with conflicting answers regarding whose responsibility, staff or  relatives, this was.   We also found that people's previous preferences were not being considered when people had lost the  ability to recall and communicate what those preferences were. For example, foods that people had chosen  not to eat or did not like, such as meat, were given to them despite the fact they had previously not wanted  to eat such foods. People's pre admission assessment and care plans did not contain sufficient detail,  including what foods they did not like, in order to ensure these preferences were met.   The care plans we looked at did not always contain sufficient information or guidance, including on how  people wanted to be cared for. For example, in relation to refusals of medicines, diabetes, or behaviour that  others may find challenging. This meant staff did not have sufficient written guidance to meet people's  needs. It also meant that new or agency staff who did not have knowledge of people and their needs would  not have sufficient written guidance to meet people's needs in the event that permanent staff were not  available.   We observed that activities on offer during our inspection did not take in to account people's individual and  specific needs. The majority of people in the home were seated in two lounge areas for most of the day. We  saw most of the entertainment on offer was loud music being played whilst at the same time a television  was switched on and put on mute with subtitles. In the afternoon of one of our visits the activity on offer was a quiz. We observed this quiz and saw only two people were able to fully participate in this. We noted for  some people this had the potential to cause frustration and upset as some people were attempting to join in and answer the questions but were unable to do so due to the nature of their cognitive impairment.  The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.        The majority of people and relatives we spoke with felt staff knew them well including their preferences,   16 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  although this was not consistently reported. One person said, ""I think they do know what I like and what I  don't like. I have been here a while and I think they know me by now."" Another person told us, ""They know  what I like and what I don't like and make sure I get it."" However, one person said, ""The activities are a bit  limited. The lady who does it tries her best but her time is limited and I don't think she fully understands the  type of people here. The loud music here kills conversation in the lounge, that's if there were people to  speak with."" Two relatives told us, ""We are not sure that they all know what [name] likes and does not like""  and ""I'm not sure they fully understand [name]. It's the little things that bother me like their nails and  making sure they are well fed and can get what they want.""  None of the people we spoke with were able to recall having recently been asked their opinion about their  care and preferences. One person told us, ""I think I filled a questionnaire in the past but I can't remember  when."" None of the relatives we spoke with could recall recent meetings to discuss and review their relatives  care needs, where appropriate. It was not always clear from looking at people's care records how much  input they and their relatives had in to formal care planning. However, most of the relatives we spoke with  confirmed they felt informally consulted and involved in their relatives care. Although one relative told us,  ""We don't feel that we are fully consulted on all the detail of [name's] care.""  Most people and relatives we spoke with told us they had no complaints and had not raised any. One person said, ""If I have any complaints then they soon see to it."" Although a relative we spoke with told us they did  not feel their concerns were always taken seriously and responded to. They said, ""We complain a number of  times about a number of things, particularly about [name's] safety and wellbeing but we feel that we have  not been listened to. We don't know if all our complaints are recorded and what response they say they have made to us."" We looked at the complaint records and could not see that the concerns raised by this relative  had been recorded and responded to. This meant we could not be certain that complaints were always  being noted and reported to the management team. However, we saw where complaints had been  recorded and reported to the registered manager they had responded appropriately in order to resolve  them.  17 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Inadequate  	" during this inspection showed that the provider had failed to meet the regulations in respect to   18 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  safe care and treatment, safeguarding, the employment of fit and proper persons, nutritional and hydration  needs, dignity and care, consent, person centred care, and good governance. In addition, the provider had  consistently failed to sustain and make improvements where non-compliance and breaches of regulations  had been identified during previous inspections. This meant the provider had failed to take sufficient action  to maintain standards in the home and ensure the service was compliant with these regulations.  At our last inspection we found that the care records we looked at contained information about people's  care needs but these were not always sufficient, accurate, and up to date. The care records we looked  showed this continued to be a concern and action had not been taken to make sufficient improvements.  This meant the home did not have in place accurate, complete, and contemporaneous records of people's  care including guidance for staff on how to meet people's needs. This was of particular concern given some  of the staff working in the home were agency staff.  During our inspection on 25 and 26 July 2017 we observed a number of incidents that did not uphold  people's rights, dignity, and constituted improper treatment. We reported our concerns and observations to  the registered manager and deputy manager during our inspection. They were not aware of such incidents,  had not received reports from other staff, and felt this was not a normal occurrence. We were concerned  about there being a culture in the home which was not person centred or respectful and had not been  identified by management or staff working in the service.   We asked staff we spoke with how they knew what was expected of them on each shift and how they  understood their responsibilities. The staff we spoke with told us that staff worked together to decide which  tasks they completed. One staff member said, ""Everybody kind of knows without being told."" Our  observations during the inspection indicated this was not always effective. For example, we observed during lunch times staff swapping and changing roles with each other which impacted on the support people  received. This meant we were concerned there was a lack of leadership and direction in order to ensure staff understood their duties, carried these out, and were accountable for them.  Staff told us that the management team was supportive and approachable. One said, ""It's the sort of place if I went to [deputy manager] and said I'm not confident, they would help.""  Another staff member said the  management were, ""Supportive, helpful."" We saw there were regular staff meetings where staff had an  opportunity to discuss the service. One staff member told us, ""[Management] will always listen to what we've got to say.""   We saw there were also regular meetings for people living in the home and their families, where people were asked their feedback about the service. A recent quality assurance survey had been conducted with people  and their relatives to gain their views on the service. However, we were not sure how effective this model of  feedback was given they had been conducted with some people living in the home who had limited ability  to provide verbal feedback due to the nature of their cognitive impairments.  19 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  "

It is situated in the village of Broughton, close to local amenities.  Accommodation is provided over two floors, in single bedrooms with en suite facilities. There is a large  sitting room set out into two separate areas, a small sitting area and a dining/activities area. Two further  lounges are situated on the ground floor. Enclosed gardens to the side and rear of the building are easily  accessible. There is also a supported living house called Redbourne House. We undertook this inspection on 17 and 18 August 2017. The last inspection was carried out on 29 and 30 March and 3 April 2017 where the  service was found to be non-compliant with the regulations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) as well as regulation 18 of the registration regulations. Due to concerns found during the inspection, the overall rating for the service was 'Inadequate' and the  service was therefore in 'special measures'.   Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months. The  expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant  improvements within this timeframe.  If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any  key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of  preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve. This service will continue to be kept  under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another  inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is  still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from  operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their  registration.  For adult social care services, the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  Following the inspection in March and April 2017, we met with the provider and have requested an interim  action plan. We also requested, and have received, weekly updates to assure us actions have been taken to  address the concerns.   After the focused inspection March and April 2017, the provider contracted the support of a management  company to help them make the required improvements and achieve compliance with the regulations. We  met with the consultant who represented the management company at this inspection. We refer to them as,  2 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  'the consultant' throughout this report.  During this inspection we found the provider's quality assurance systems continued to be ineffective. The  governance systems operated by the provider failed to cover all aspects of care delivery and did not identify  areas of the service that required improvement. The provider did not have oversight of the service as  required and was not consulted regarding people's care and support.  People who used the service did not always receive their medicines as prescribed. Instructions to staff about when medicines should be administered were not clear.   Staff had not always completed the necessary training to deliver the care and support the people who used  the service required.  People's care plans did not always contain suitable guidance to ensure staff could meet their needs  effectively and consistently.  The provider's recruitment practices were not robust. Some staff files did not contain relevant recruitment  information and thorough checks were not completed before agency staff worked with the people who used the service.  Elements of the environment did not meet people's needs; we found a window that did not have a restrictor, radiator covers were not in place and wooden garden furniture was water damaged with split and pliable  wood.  We found that people had restrictions in their lives that had not been agreed as in their best interests.   The registered manager did not have access to some people's care records and failed to ensure they have  oversight of their care. This meant there could be delays in any care or treatment they required.  We saw that improvements had been made with regards to some of the risks we identified at our previous  inspection, but found further evidence that the provider was not mitigating risks as required. For example,  legionella checks were not being carried out which put people who used the service at unnecessary risk. We  also found items of food, which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen in the freezer and  items that were past their used by or best before dates in fridges.  Staff, who received adequate support and mentorship were deployed in suitable numbers to meet people's  needs. Staff had completed safeguarding training and were aware of their responsibilities to report any  potential abuse and episodes of poor care they became aware of.  People were supported to eat a diet of their choosing and encouraged to make healthy choices.  People were treated with dignity and respect by staff; they were enabled to make choices in their daily lives.  We saw people taking part in different activities throughout the inspection.  The service had a registered manager who fulfilled their regulatory obligations to inform the Commission of  notifiable events that occurred with the service.  3 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  Inadequate    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not always safe. People did not always receive  their medicines as prescribed.   Recruitment practices were not robust and the suitability of  agency staff was not adequately assessed.  Risks were not appropriately mitigated to ensure the health,  safety and welfare of the people who used the service.  Staff were deployed in suitable numbers to meet the needs of the people who used the service.  Staff had been trained to recognise the signs that could indicate  abuse had occurred and understood their responsibilities to  report any poor care they became aware of.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always effective. People who used the  service had restrictions placed upon them that had not been  agreed as in their best interests.   People were not always supported by staff who had the skills and abilities to meet their needs effectively.  Some parts of the service had not been adapted effectively to  meet people needs.  Staff received regular supervision and annual appraisals.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always caring. Some people's care records  were not stored appropriately and the registered manager did  not have access to them.   People's needs were met by attentive and caring staff.   People were treated with dignity and respect by staff. However,  we saw staff had used inappropriate language when describing  some care interventions.  4 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  People were supported to make choices in their daily lives.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always responsive. Although some people's  care plans had been updated since our last inspection, we found  that some contained generic information and lacked appropriate guidance for staff to follow.  The registered provider had a complaints policy and procedure  in place. The procedure was available in an easy read format to  make it more accessible to the people who used the service.   People who used the service were encouraged to take part in  activities of their choosing.  	  Inadequate    The service was not always well-led. The governance systems  and processes at the service were not effective.  The provider did not take responsibility for the day to day  management of the service.   There was a registered manager in place and the CQC received  notifications as required.  5 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017     Amber House  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  The inspection took place on the 17 and 18 August 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was  completed by three adult social care inspectors  Before this inspection, we reviewed the information we held about the service, such as notifications we had  received from the provider and their actions plans submitted to us following the last inspection.  Notifications are when providers send us information about certain changes, events or incidents that occur.  We spoke with the local authority commissioners and the local authority safeguarding team.  During the inspection we spoke with the registered manager, five members of care staff and two members of domestic staff. We also spoke with four people who used the service and three visiting healthcare  professionals. The consultant from the management company the provider had commissioned to support  with the required improvements at the service was also spoken with.  We looked at six people's care plans along with the associated risk assessments and Medication  Administration Records (MARs). We also looked at how the service used the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and  Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) to ensure that when people were assessed as lacking capacity to  make informed decisions themselves or when they were deprived of their liberty, actions were taken in their  best interest.  We also looked at a selection of documentation pertaining to the management and running of the service.  This included action plans, policies and procedures, business continuity plans, personal emergency  evacuation plans, recruitment information for staff, staff training records as well as audits and quality  monitoring information.  6 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (g) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care  and treatment. We found people's prescribed medicines including PRN (as required) medicines were not  recorded on their medicines administration records (MARs). We were unable to find information when the  medicines should be administered or when they had been given. We also found protocols did contain clear  instructions and suitable guidance to ensure they were administered safely and consistently.  During this inspection we saw one person had not received a medicine as prescribed. They had been  prescribed a medicine in patch form to be applied every 72 hours. However, staff had consistently applied  the patch every 96 hours. This had not been identified by any of the staff team during the timeframe of  records we checked, which was between 10 July and 17 August 2017. We have asked the registered manager to discuss this with the person's GP.  Staff had recorded they had given PRN medicines for pain, but not what the effect had been. Staff had  handwritten some MARs, however, full instructions about medicines had not been transcribed and a counter signature, to help prevent mistakes, had not always been made. Some medicines had been written by the  prescriber as 'as directed'; this did not give clear instruction to staff and we have asked the registered  manager to discuss this with the prescriber. Unclear directions posed a risk that errors may occur and  people may not receive the medicines they had been prescribed.  We saw protocols were in place for staff guidance when people who used the service were prescribed  medicines to be administered 'when required', referred to as PRN. The protocols did not give full  information to staff. For example, some people were prescribed a medicine to reduce anxieties up to two or  four times a day when required, however, there was no information about the interval required between the  doses. Other protocols referred to staff administering medicines when required when people 'displayed  signs of constipation', 'displayed signs of suffering' or 'for outward signs of agitation and anxiety'; there was  no information in the protocols about what these signs were for individual people. We also saw that some  people were prescribed medicines as a variable dose, for example one to two to be taken at night. There was no information to guide staff regarding the decision-making about which dose to administer.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  People who used the service told us they received their medicines on time. One person said, ""I always get it  on time, I have them at night too.""  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. We looked at  three staff recruitment files and found two had positive disclosure and barring service (DBS) checks. One of   7 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  these staff members had not declared the offences on their application form contrary to the provider's  recruitment policy which should preclude them from working at the service.  During this inspection we were told by the consultant that there had been a number of staff had left the  provider recently. They said, ""We have made a lot of change since the last inspection and some staff have  left which we view as a positive step. We have kept all of the ones we wanted to keep and lost the ones we  were happy to see go."" The registered manager added, ""The staff we have now are dedicated and very  compassionate.""   We asked how the provider ensured they deployed sufficient staff and were told that agency staff were being used as an interim measure. The consultant explained, ""We are currently using agency staff. The agency  provides all of the relevant information regarding staff that we need."" We reviewed the information held by the service in relation to agency staff and found that they could not  provide evidence that suitable checks had been undertaken. There was no evidence to support that  references had been gained by the agency or that gaps in people's employment history had been explored.   We assessed the recruitment of three permanent staff and found that interview questions and responses  were not always available.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, fit and proper persons employed. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (a) (b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe  care and treatment. We found the provider failed to appropriately assess and mitigate known risks in areas,  including, but not limited to, buildings works being carried out at the service, emergency evacuation plans  as well as fire and building safety.   During this inspection we found improvements had been made to the risks we had previously identified but  identified other risks that had not been appropriately mitigated.   Building works had been completed and no longer posed at risk to the people who used the service. We saw evidence that the local fire safety officer had visited and due to improvements made following our  inspection had no concerns regarding fire safety management at the service. We saw personal emergency  evacuation plans (PEEPs) had been updated for some people but not all. This meant they were at risk of not  receiving the support they required in an emergency situation.   We completed a tour of the premises and saw that work had been completed to improve the environment  but found that an upstairs window did not have a restrictor on it as required. This meant it could be could be opened fully, which put people who used the service at risk.  The service had no risk assessment regarding Legionnaires disease. Maintenance personnel told us the  service had hot and cold stored water in tanks, which posed a potential risk of legionella; they had not been  given any guidance regarding prevention of legionella. A cold water tank at the top of the basement steps  was in poor repair and leaking; a plumber was called out to attend to the leak on the day of inspection.  Maintenance personnel showed us water temperature checks they had completed; these were to ensure the hot water outlets were not above 43 degrees to prevent scalding. There was no evidence that unused  shower heads were descaled, disinfected and flushed. They confirmed the hot water tank was set at 60   8 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  degrees centigrade, which is required to help prevent legionella. Senior staff told us they would contact an  appropriate company and ensure a risk assessment was completed for the risk of Legionnaires disease.  We found items of fruit, salad and vegetables that were past their recommended 'use by' and 'best before'  dates. In freezers, we found items of food which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen. There were also packets of unopened vegetables that were not sealed. Items in the fridge such as processed meat  had labels, produced by catering staff, of when these had been opened and when they should be used by.  However, we found the labels did not match the 'use before date once opened' recommended by food  producers on the packet. These were mentioned to the registered manager to dispose of and address with  catering staff.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 (2) (a) (b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. The action we have asked the provider to  take can be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (h) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. We found concerns regarding infection prevention and control. We saw there was no dirty to  clean flow within the laundry room. Soiled washing was being stored in baskets on the floor alongside clean  laundry also stored in open baskets, creating the potential of cross contamination. Areas of the service  required a deep clean and staff failed to use personal protective equipment (PPE) when required.  During this inspection we found that the environment had been refurbished to a high standard and the  cleanliness of the service had greatly improved. Communal areas were clean and free from odours. Rooms  had been re-decorated and bathrooms and toilets had been re-fitted. We observed staff using PPE when  required and were told about the new laundry procedures in place. We noted appropriate storage of dirty  and clean clothes in the laundry. Mops and other cleaning products were stored appropriately and we saw  evidence that the domestic staff's weekly hours had increased by close to 50%. All of these factors helped to  ensure people were cared for in a clean and hygienic environment.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safeguarding  service users from abuse and improper treatment. Staff had not always followed the provider's safeguarding policies in practice. For example, the deputy manager began an investigation rather than consulting with  the local safeguarding team to establish if this is what was required or whether the safeguarding team would complete their own investigation. We were told by staff and visiting professionals the training that staff  received on restrictive interventions, known as BASIS training, included details and a demonstration of  unapproved interventions that inflicted pain on the service users.   During this inspection we spoke with staff who had a clear understanding of the different types of abuse that may occur and the actions they would be required to take to keep people safe. Records showed staff had  completed safeguarding vulnerable adults training. A member of staff we spoke with said, ""I would report  abuse to my manager immediately. It's my duty.""  The consultant told us, ""We are aware of the local authorities safeguarding procedures and would report  abuse to them but we may need to complete part of an investigation to establish some facts so we could be  assured our service users were safe.""  We saw evidence that staff had completed an accredited three day training course to ensure any use of   9 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  physical interventions would be done safely. This helped to reduce the risk that people would be injured  during the delivery of essential care.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, staffing. We  found evidence that there had been several days when there was insufficient staff on duty to provide the  necessary care and support to people. This had impacted on the delivery of care for specific people who  used the service. When we spoke with the registered manager they told us they did not use a dependency  tool to calculate staffing levels for the service. They were unable to show us any systems they used to  establish the amount of staff, which should be on duty to ensure service users were supported on a one to  one basis, and other service users' needs were effectively met.  During this comprehensive inspection we saw that staff were deployed in appropriate numbers to meet the  needs of the people who used the service. We saw evidence that a dependency tool was being utilised to  ensure staffing levels were adequate. At the time of the inspection, there were eight people who lived in the  service and one person who stayed for respite care four days a week. Staff told us five people had one to one support from staff for 12 hours each day from 8am to 8pm and one person had this level of support between 9am and 5pm. A seventh person had one to one support for three hours a day, which could be used flexibly  when required. There were eight staff on duty during the day, which included a senior care support worker  and four staff at night. This level of staffing meant there was sufficient to meet the current numbers of  people who used the service and the level of needs they had. The registered manager was supernumerary to the rota and worked usual working hours during the week.  A member of staff commented, ""Things used to get a bit crazy, we would be running around and there never  seemed to be enough of us but things are different now. I think it really helps them [the people who used the service] when we have more time to spend with them.""   A visiting professional said, ""Now they don't have the day service here things are much better. When I've  visited I haven't had concerns about the number of staff.""  10 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-compliant with  Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, need for  consent. We found the application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) was inconsistent. People had  restrictions in place around access to cigarettes and coffee at certain times. Another person who used the  service was having their mattress removed from their bedroom throughout the day. We were unable to find  any documentation within the service to show the decision to remove the mattress had been discussed and  recorded as in their best interest as the least restrictive option for them. We also found staff's knowledge in  relation to the MCA was limited.  During this inspection, we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was  required to ensure compliance with Regulation 11. The registered manager told us the restrictions around  people' coffee and cigarette intake continued and had been in place at a previous service. They stated that it was in the person's best interest but there was no evidence available to support this. The registered  manager explained, ""It is something that has always been in place and it does work really well but I will hold  my hands up we haven't had a best interest meeting about it."" The provider informed us that the person is  no longer living at the service so it no longer subjected to these restrictions.   Following the last inspection in March and April 2017 the registered manager told us that all staff would be  retrained in the MCA. However, at the time of this inspection no staff had completed refresher training in this area.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, need for consent. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found  at the end of this report.  We saw evidence to confirm that best interest meetings had taken place and decisions were in place for  other aspects in the service including the removal of a person's mattress. This had been agreed as the least  restrictive option and necessary to ensure the person, 'moved on' in the daily routines. A visiting  professional stated, ""I have been involved in supporting the service so that appropriate and least restrictive  care plans have been developed following best interest meetings.""  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and  equipment. We found concerns regarding the maintenance of the building. A meter cupboard door was  falling off its hinges when unlocked. An unlocked cupboard was found to contain loose screws, a knife, an  opened paint can and other debris. The unlocked cupboard had visible wires hanging and a light fitting  without a bulb, connected to the electric supply. We had issues with the lack of appropriate signage in the  kitchen accessed by people who used the service. Radiators did not have covers in place as required. When  we requested a copy of the most recent electrical wiring certificate we found this was dated 1 December  2012 and valid for one year. When we brought this to the attention of the registered manager they told us   11 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  they would arrange to have this checked as a matter of urgency.  During this inspection we saw that the majority of issues identified at our previous inspection had been  addressed but further work was needed before compliance was achieved. We saw evidence that an  electrical wiring testing was complete in May 2017. Signage was in place, cupboards in communal areas  were locked and access to them was restricted. However, there was only one radiator cover in place and this was at the entrance to the service. The registered manager explained, ""The provider is making the radiator  covers, all the radiators are different sizes so each was is bespoke. They are nearly finished and will be in  place very soon.""  We found there had been a roof leak in a store room where care files were held. These records had not been  affected, but two boxes [plastic stacking crates with lids] containing personal items belonging to a person  who used the service were wet and the contents at risk of damage. These were moved. There were other  issues such as wooden garden furniture, which was water damaged that had left the wood split and pliable.  There were two wheel chairs in need of cleaning. A team leader told us the garden furniture was to be  disposed of and the wheelchairs were rarely used, but they would see they were cleaned.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and equipment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  During this inspection we saw records that confirmed staff had completed a range of training to equip them  will the skills and abilities to complete their roles. However, a number of agency staff were being used at the  service and their training records showed that had not completed any training in relation to supporting  people with autism. The consultant explained, ""We do recognise that as an issue, but there are no agencies  in the area that can supply us with staff who have that training."" They went on to say, ""We do closely monitor the staff so we are satisfied they are supporting people in a person centred way.""  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, staffing. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found at the end  of this report.  Records showed staff received appropriate levels of support and supervision. All staff had received a  supervision session since the last inspection. The supervision record had space to discuss the last  supervision and any concerns or actions that had arisen from it. Whether staff had any concerns and what  actions would be required to address them and any training or other recommendations.   People's health and social care needs were met by a range of healthcare professionals. Over the course of  the inspection a number of professionals visited the service. A visiting professional told us, ""I have worked  with Amber House for years. They have had issues in the past but I find they do everything they can for the  people who live here. I am always contacted if there is an issue and I feel that my advice is implemented and well received.""  People were supported to eat and balanced diet of their choosing. We saw the menus were written in  advance and reflected the choices a younger age group would make. The menus also included treats such  as a takeaway once a week. We observed the lunchtime experience and saw that people were supported  appropriately and were provided with adapted beakers, cutlery and plate guards to aid their independence.  12 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We saw care records and other personal or confidential information were stored securely. Staff told us they  understood the importance of maintaining confidentiality. Access to computerised records was restricted to ensure private and sensitive information could only be accessed by appropriate staff. The registered  manager explained, ""We [the management and administrative] staff have our own passwords and different  levels of access. I can see things that other staff can't, it depends what they need to know for their job.""   We asked to see records from the part of the service where supported living care was delivered. The  registered manager told us they did not have access to these records. They said, ""The senior staff that work  there complete all of the paper work. I don't really check it."" The consultant explained, ""The records are held on a local compute which is not linked to Amber House."" This meant that the care and support of some  people who used the service was not overseen by the registered manager as required. Not having access to  the information could lead to delays in specific care and support being delayed. Following the inspection we were informed that the supported living part of the service would close to enable required improvements to  continue at Amber House.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and  equipment. While undertaking a tour of the building we observed a person who used the service naked,  compromising their dignity by undressing in public. Staff had difficulty assisting and encouraging them to  dress in order to maintain their dignity. We also heard staff asking a person if they needed to use the toilet in  front of their peers.   During this comprehensive inspection we found the provider had ensured necessary improvements had  been made and compliance with this regulation had been achieved. On a tour of the service we saw that  towels were placed in strategic areas of the service so that if a person did remove their clothing staff could  protect their modesty. Care plans had been developed to ensure staff knew how to support people in these  circumstances.   Throughout the inspection we saw staff treating people in a dignified and respectful way. We did hear a  member of staff speaking to a person in a way that did not appear age appropriate. However, when we  checked their care plan we saw that this was a known strategy to reduce the person's anxiety. A visiting  professional we spoke with confirmed this to be accurate.   We did however, see that a member of staff had recorded in the accident book that they had, 'reprimanded'  a person who used the service following an incident of behaviour that challenged the service. We  highlighted this to the registered manager to address.  We saw staff interacted well with people who used the service showing patience and demonstrating  knowledge of their preferences. One of the people who used the service described the staff as, ""Wonderful.""  Another person said, ""I can do what I want, the staff are nice to me.""  13 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  People who used the service told us that they were encouraged to make decisions and choices in their daily  lives. One person said, ""I choose what clothes [to wear]"" and ""They make lovely meals, I have a choice.""  Another person said they had a nice room and had a DVD player so they could watch DVDs in their room.  We saw evidence that people were given information and explanations in an appropriate format, which  promoted their understanding. Storyboards were used to support people's understanding of specific  activities such as appointments with healthcare professionals, visits from family or events. A storyboard uses pictorial symbols or photographs with numbers, times and dates to enable people to understand what will  occur and when. We also saw easy read versions of 'consent and capacity', 'MCA and DoLS' and 'No Secrets'  documents in people's care files.  We saw that advocacy information was stored in people's care files and that an advocacy group meeting  had taken place. The meeting was used to enable an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to meet  the people who used the service and start to develop relationships so people understood what support was  available to them.  14 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, person centred  care. We found the quality of the instructions provided to staff to keep people safe was varied and brief. For  example, one person's care plan said, 'use distraction techniques' but included no description of what these distraction techniques should be or for how long these should be used. Other care plans described 'habitual  behaviours', but did not detail what these were or how staff could recognise them and stated 'provide me  with my preferred method of  communication', but did not describe or offer guidance as to what this was.   During this inspection, we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was  required to ensure compliance with regulation 9. The consultant told us, ""We have had support from the  behavioural support team but all of the care plans are live documents and a work in progress. They will be  updated as people's needs changes or as the strategies we have put in place reduce some of their anxieties  and known behaviours.""  We saw that some people's care plans included detailed and personalised guidance that enabled staff to  understand the support people required when they were showing signs of agitation. However, we found  other care plans still contained generic guidance. For example, one person's behavioural management plan  stated staff should, 'use low arousal approach and distraction techniques' and that a precursor to  behaviours that challenged the service and others was indicated when, 'facial expressions change'. Failing  to provide accurate and detailed guidance to staff means people's needs would not be met consistently and effectively.  Descriptions of when physical interventions were to be used were generic and open to interpretation. One  person's behaviour management plan stated, 'the approved techniques must be proportionate to the  behaviour and applied for the minimum time necessary'. The descriptions of the support people required  were open to interpretation and lacked clear guidance.  We were told and saw evidence that care plans for people who lived at the service on a permanent basis had been updated. However, the care plans for people who used the service on a respite basis still required re- writing. This meant there was a risk that staff did not have the guidance they required to deliver care in line  with people's needs and preferences.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and equipment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 16 (1) (2) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, receiving and acting on complaints. We spoke to relatives and relevant professionals who told us they had raised a  number of formal complaints to the registered manager. These were in relation to the continuity of staff,   15 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  staffing levels, the impact of day care service and subjective recording in daily records and not following  care plans. However, the registered manager told us there had been no complaints since 2015.  During this inspection the consultant told us that improvements had been made with regards to the  complaints management within the service. They said, ""We have introduced a 'meet the manager day'. All  stakeholders, service users, relatives and professionals can meet the manager and discuss any issues or  thoughts they have. It is just one way to show they are accessible and open to feedback.""  The provider's complaints policy was displayed in the entrance to the service. It had been produced in an  easy read format that helped to ensure it was accessible to the people who used the service. Complaints  information was also available in people's care plans  A visiting relative we spoke with said, ""I have had discussions with the manager in the past and because she  acted on them I didn't feel the need to raise anything formally. I think the manager is receptive to feedback  and takes things on board."" A person who used the service said they had no complaints regarding the  service they received. They said, ""None at all; no reasons to.""  During the inspection we saw people taking part in activities of their choosing. One person told us they  enjoyed painting and arts and crafts. Another person said they liked to go shopping and swimming. A third  person said, ""I go to the shops to buy CDs, DVDs and books.""  16 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulations 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. This meant there was also a breach of Regulation 8 General.   During this inspection we found that some improvements had been made across the service, but further  work was required before the service achieved compliance against regulations 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18 and 19.   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, good  governance. There was no structured quality monitoring system in place that ensured identified shortfalls  were addressed in a timely way.   During this inspection we saw that internal quality monitoring systems had not improved. The consultant  told us they were fully aware of the provider's shortfalls in governance and would develop appropriate  systems. They said, ""The governance arrangements across the organisation are being further developed to  reduce the sometimes disjointed approach and to enhance the collation, interpretation and analysis of  information and subsequent action.""   The service did not have established and effective systems to assess monitor and improve the quality and  safety of care or to assess and mitigate risks. Accident and incident audits were not taking place, the  registered manager told us, ""I do look at all of the incidents but I don't audit them."" Failing to review  incidents and identify patterns and trends could lead to preventable incidents taking place within the  service.   Care plan audits were not being undertaken. We saw that monthly care plan assessments were completed  but these were not reviewed in conjunction with accident and incident records to establish in the guidance  provided to staff remained appropriate. They also failed to highlight that people were subject to restrictions  in their daily lives that had not been agreed, as in their best interests.  The provider had not undertaken audits of staff recruitment even though issues were highlighted at the last  inspection. The provider had also failed to audit the documentation provided by the recruitment company  who supplied agency staff. This meant they had not assured themselves of the agency staff's suitability and  fitness to work with vulnerable people.    We saw that some medication audits had been completed on a monthly basis, but these had not been  effective in highlighting that a person was not receiving their medicines as prescribed. The in effective audits being carried out lead to a person who had had been prescribed a particular medication to be taken every  72 hours receiving their medicines every 96 hours. The shortfalls in auditing could have led to the person  experiencing un-necessary pain.   17 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  Medication audits had also not identified that some medicines had been written by the prescriber 'as  directed'; which meant staff did not have adequate guidance to ensure staff knew have to administer  medicines safely and consistently.   Water temperature checks were carried out by maintenance staff but there was no evidence to show that  legionella checks were completed as required. This meant risks to the health, safety and welfare of the  people who used the service were not being assessed or mitigated.   We asked the registered manager to provide audits or the care and support provided in the supported living  service. The registered manager told us that they did not have managerial oversight and was not conducting quality assurance checks, they said, ""We have a senior member of staff there but I have to hold my hands up, I don't monitor it."" Following the inspection the consultant informed us that the provider intended to de- register the supported living service. This would be done following a notice period being served to the  people who used that part of the service.  There were no systems and processes to ensure the safe storage and disposal of food items. We identified  concerns with out of date, past the used by date and non-freeze food items. When we highlighted our  concerns immediate action was taken but the provider had no systems to identify issues with food storage  and safety.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 and the subsequent report we highlighted  concerns that radiators did not have covers and posed a risk to the people who used the service. Despite  this, during this inspection we found only one radiator cover was in place. This showed that provider did not  have effective systems in place to mitigate known risks.   The consultant told us, ""We are completely in a limbo situation, we have actions plans so know the areas  that we need to improve. We aren't auditing the work we have just completed because we know it's been  done to a high standard and we are not auditing the other areas because we know that needs to be  updated. Any audits we did now would just prevent us fixing us things.""  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, need for good governance. The action we have asked the provider to take can  be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (registration) Regulations 2009, notification of other  incidents. The registered manager failed to notify the Commission of two incidents where people had  injured themselves and required hospital treatment.   During this inspection we reviewed the accident and incident records held at the service against the  information we had received from the provider. We found that we had been informed of all notifiable events  as required. The registered manager commented, ""The incidents that didn't get reported were a mistake. I  know what needs to be reported. We try to be open and transparent about everything that happens.""  The registered manager told us they had not been supported in their role to ensure positive outcomes for  people. They said, ""The directors are very supportive in some areas, but they don't have a background in  care so when it came down to the residents I was left to get on with things myself. I have had more support  from [name of the consultant] in the short time they have been here than I ever have before."" The consultant told us, ""We know there are a lot of improvements to make. I initially came on board for nine weeks and that   18 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  has already been extended to 12 months. I am committed to turning things around and making this a good  service for all of our residents.""  19 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.
